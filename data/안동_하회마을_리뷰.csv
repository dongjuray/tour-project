"Rental cycle recommended It's a World Heritage tourist site, but I was able to see a lovely view as if I was in a Korean drama. The weather was good so I enjoyed the rental cycle."
"Updated Andong and Hahoe Transport Oct 2024 This active ancient village is simply stunning. 19km outside Andong town - A must see on your trip to Korea! We stayed in Andong for 3 nights (in what turned out to be a love hotel - but that’s another story). Take local bus number 210 (formerly the 246) from outside the Andong Elementary School. The bus stop is a large shelter with electronic signage. Once on the bus, the stops are also shown on a digital screen in English. Get off at the Hahoe village not the ‘Hahoe village entrance’ stop. The crazy mad bus driver took about 50minutes from downtown. Do not mistake this village for the Andong Folk village as per the Lonely Planet guide which is only 4km away. Thie latter was also worth visiting but not a patch on Hahoe. We recommend hiring a bike once inside Hahoe. 10000 won for a regular bike all day or 20000 for an electric bike for 2hrs. We arrived early at 930am and had the village almost to ourselves. The riding saved a long day on our feet and was simply blissful!! We spent 4-5hrs cruising around and lunching. The return bus is right outside the Mask Museum. Get all your tourism information at the bus terminal before you head into the village or into Andong town as it was a bit tricky to navigate otherwise. Also note - the Andong train station in downtown is now closed. A new much larger ktx train station and bus terminal are about 3km+ outside of downtown. Taxi cost 10000 to our centrally located hotel. Note, the BBQ restaurants in ‘rib street’ whilst reputed locally raised beef, these restaurants are very expensive and one wanted us to buy a minimum of three plates for $100."
"A gem of a folk village Andong Hahoe Village is a great reminder of Korea in the past. The village is well preserved and the folk village is a wonder to explore. We learned that Queen Elizabeth visited this very place and had tea there with the locals. There are cafes for your coffee fix and so much to see. It's incredible that a slice of the past can co-exist with the present in such a way. It also has the perfect photo spots so if you can rent hanbok and explore, do so!"
Do not walk.  Rent an electric bike.
"People live in this village so most of the buildings is off-limit.  If you watch K-dramas, you may recognize the river and the river bank.  Make sure to rent an electric bike to go around.  That was very fun and it allows you to explore the whole village."
"Authentic Despite the heat we visited the village on foot but you can rent bikesIn short, magnificent architecture of the renovations in progress, one of the two clan villages of South Korea. A priori there are villas for leaders and common premises for those who accompanied themOnce you have taken your ticket, take the air-conditioned shuttle that takes you to the foot of the village.For the return, same shuttle.If you are tempted, you can visit the museum of masks, it is free, and one can drink a very cold drinkDirty regret for a UNESCO-listed villageThere is a lot of work to make it clean and avoid taste mistakes…."
Good experience Good experience.. despite the heat we went to the village very early and rented bikes at the entrance to the village.. pleasant ride and we ended up with the visit to the museum of masks Great experience and thatched roof traditional houses Came here to see the traditional thatched roof houses in a traditional villiage. THey say it's a living villiage but nowdays it's seems like it just operates for tourism with most of the traditional houses renovated and rebuilt for tourists to have an overnight stay experience.Still cool to see how they used to live and the renovations based on historical designs. There is a 650 year old tree inside the complex (you wouldn't think so if you didn't know it! but it's a super wide trunk).Daily mask show and the mask museum just near the ticketing office where you have to wait for a bus to take you closer to the villiage. From there it's a good 1-2 hours to explore on foot. Great way to spend half a day. 6 of the houses there are designated national treasures only.
"Finally a traditional village, a real one Traditional village which is relatively well preserved (we can still see the electrical wires, air conditioning etc. in this way they should be hidden)You can enter the garden of certain properties Bring hats and water because it was only 24 degrees but like a bowl it was hotIf you have a car, go first to the BUYONGDAE cliff to see the village from above with the riverAnd then to the BYEONGSAN SEOWON CONFUCIAN ACADEMY 5 km away. Small academy but quiet also along the river A magnificent site This site is very well preserved and allows you to see period buildings. As we were staying in the village, we were able to enjoy it in the morning before the bulk of visitors arrived (and even at this time of year, there are fewer of them).We had plenty of time to wander the streets and immerse ourselves in the Joseon era.Although the temperatures are still cool, the must of this period: the cherry blossoms everywhere."
"Expected more but educational It was a good trip despite the very cold December.You will need to take the shuttle after buying your ticket. The shuttle brings you to the entrance. I was recommended to started with Hahoe Mask Dance at the outdoor theatre. There are heaters.It was educational for me. The performers did their best despite the cold and i enjoyed.The village itself was average. Not sure what was happening, there are vehicles here and there at the houses."

"Too idealized in guide It’s a pretty authentic village but I expected something elseNo house to visit, a little lack of maintenance in my opinion, it is still classified by UnescoOn the other hand, before taking the shuttle, we visited the mask museum which was very interesting."
To do absolutely Village to absolutely see even if it is very touristy. Don't miss the 2 p.m. show. Allow 2 hours for the visit to get a good look at the village.
"KTX to Andong Beautiful place,Traditional houses, mask dance performances. We stayed in Andong for one day travelling in from Seoul ( Cheongnyangni )via KTX Eum the journey was around 2 hours 18m. There is tourist information at the station. From the KTX station in Andong you can walk across to the bus station which have the  buses to Hahoe folk village and other sites such as Weolyeonggyo ( the moon light bridge) .Note the KTX or bus station is not in the town. There are lockers in the bus station for luggage. You will need loads of change😀. We got to there just in time for a mask dance performance. We the rest of the day walking around the village. We took the bus back to the bus station and took a taxi ( we used the kakao taxi to get the taxi) to Andong gurume resort 1 night stay so that we could photograph the moon light bridge) . Traditional place to stay  we had a Hanok house to ourselves. ( we used papago app to communicate with staff as didn’t know much English and we didn’t know much Korean. They were very helpful) . We used Navermaps to navigate as Google maps doesn’t work there( tip- search what you want in google, copy the korean word in to navermaps to navigate).  You could walk down the bridge from this hotel( some effort required walking back up😀). We had a Korean dinner at one of the restaurants near the bridge , delicious.I would like one more days stay to visit other sites in Andong but we had already booked a place at our next location Gyeongju.you can take a bus from the bus station near the KTX to Gyeongju."
"Interesting Authentic Historical Vilages Unfortunately, almost of shopping and food closes at 7 mm or even earlier. All the attractions for which most tourist would come are the 3 historical villages (Hahoe, Gunja, etc) So they are located pretty far from each other, So you will not be able to visit them all in one day. So if you want to visit all them plan to stay at least for 2 full days."
"Closeup of traditional agricultural village This is a real place that avoided destruction by being inconvenient.  Thatch roofs.  Old style pre-20th C layout.  A place to learn about masks as well as rural lifestyle.  One can stay here in upgraded houses, as do some residents.  Food, snacks available.  It was warm in May, not much shade."
"A unique cultural experience that will leave a mark on you A unique cultural experience that left a mark on us. Outside of the city rhythm of life, the village conveys a mood and feeling that originates from different times. Spend a couple of nights at the village, try to get accustomed to the routine there and you will not regret it. I would also recommend having a nice coffee from the wonderful gentleman Mr Kim Gi Young at the entrance of the village on the left."
Stunning and Peaceful!
"I would recommend visiting the folk village for anyone looking to get away from the bustling city, looking for more nature, and looking to explore historical hanoks and traditional mask dance Korean culture. The staff at the visitor center were welcoming and helpful, and they had maps and informational brochures in various languages. Some highlights include the daily mask dance performance in the amphitheater, a guided tour of the village, the 600+ year old tree, and the pine forest along the river bank. The landscape is gorgeous and breathtaking!There are also a handful of activities/sites to visit on the edge of the village including the Mask Museum, cafes and restaurants, the Confucian academy, and the “observatory” overlook point on the other side of the Nakdong River. My friend and I stayed in the village for 2 nights, and that allowed us to have a peaceful morning to wander around the village before additional tourists arrived for the day. Something to note is that many if not all of the shops and restaurants in the village and near the village entrance (where you pay admission to enter) did not accept foreign credit cards so we paid for everything in cash. Furthermore, it seemed that most of the restaurants closed by 19:00, so if you plan to have dinner in the village, be prepared to eat dinner before then."
"An afternoon of Culture & a 600 yo tree A world heritage village where people actually lived. Not as large as I thought this making it easy to see everything. There are English speaking tour guides available if you are lost. A nice lady spend almost 2 hours sharing with me the various homes of the noble. Apparently, those houses with tile roof belong to the 'rich and famous ' while those with straw roofs belong to peasants. She also brought me to the 600 yo tree where you can make a wish. Be sure to walk through the pine forest on route back to the entrance. Right across the benches is Buyongdae cliff. Unfortunately, the boat is not operating. Not sure if it low season or if its due to the season. Best way getting there is from Andong Bus Terminal (not intercity or express bus terminal) and take bus 210 which looks like a tourist bus but is actually a local bus. Alight at Hakoe Village stop, just after Hakoe Village entrance stop. Take the free shuttle pink bus and you are on your way."
"Amazing Hanok village Andong Hahoe village is one of the most famous Hanok villages, the village itself was beautiful, I loved how peaceful this village was. The houses, autumn trees, and scenery were really beautiful. There are a lot of interesting performances to see such as talchum, Korean traditional masked dance in the village.  I also got to see an amazing sunset from the Buyongdae cliff. It was truly a sight to see!!"
"Beautiful folk village Hahoe folk village is very beautiful, especially in the autumn season with colourful leaves and traditional-style Korean houses. we walked around the entire area for 1 hour, and we could also watch mask dance performances. The place was so calm and quiet and it was different from the other folk villages I have seen so far. I enjoyed the visit and I wish to go there again."

Great folk history...must see!
"Hahoe Folk Village is a great place for all ages young and old, families, and those traveling alone. The village offers many different views and experiences from a 600 year old tree to the reenactment of the Hahoe Mask tale. Prices are reasonable: 1500₩ for kids, 2500₩ for teens, and 5000₩ for adults. A shuttle will take you to the village after you buy your tickets. The village still has many residents, please be respectful. One of the best houses to see is the Bukchondaek House, it is the oldest house to the Ryu family. **once you get off the shuttle, stop by the information booth (international) and see if there is someone that speaks your language. Many young people are ready to practice English and other languages. I went on a slow day, and was able to tour the village with a young English speaker...it was awesome! Good luck and have fun!"
"Authentic place Hahoe Folk Village is arguably Andong’s top sight as the authentic Joseon-era houses in the village are all inhabited.  The surrounding mountain and river makes the village even more scenic making it a popular filming location for many Joseon-era films and shows (“The Kingdom” being the most recent).  The village does lack the entertainment factor compared to some of the other folk villages in Korea but because of it, it’s probably never all that crowded.  Being quite far from the urban areas adds to its authenticity."
a must-go place in Andong Hahoe Village is a must-go place in Andong. It was nice to be able to feel the quiet countryside scenery and Korean beauty.It was easy to walk without using an electric cart. It's good to take a walk around the village slowly.
"Amazing Village to explore UNESCO is a recognized site in South Korea.  Korean village is settled here with lots of traditional houses.  One of the most amazing places I have visited in Korea so far.  It was a beautiful, rural village that is not only a tourist attraction but people still live and work there.  I was there on the first week of January and it was quite crowded.  The entrance fee was charged 5000 WON, which included entry to see the Mask Museum and the Mask Dance Performance.  I found the mask dance to be quite captivating and fascinating, I would really recommend the mask dance, must see the village next to the walkway and the green rice plant surrounded by the river.  You may need a full day to explore this village as there are many hidden places that you can remember.  It was a great experience for me."
Visit this place for the well-preserved hanok houses and the unique unadultered natural landscapes.
"The 600-year-old Hahoe Village boasts exquisite well-preserved scenic sights like no other. The big complex provides visitors with the unique opportunity to experience Joseon-era rural life. When you visit around September to October, you can get the chance to snap some photos with cosmos flowers in the area.*Visitors can also hike to Buyongdae Cliff for a panoramic view of the village."
Mandatory trip from Andong The village is a delightful and beautiful relic. There is a great history to this village and it is in a tranquil and beautiful setting. Make sure to take in the daily mask show and to stay a night. It is simply enchanting once the tourist crowds slack off and you have the place to yourself - particularly early in the morning. Magical!
"Beautiful This folk village is really a must - see location if you are visiting Andong. I would recommend getting a guide, especially if you don't understand korean. It was a really hot day, but we still enjoyed this village. It's really authentic."
"well preserved village We took the bus from Gyeongyu to Andong, an hour and half ride and another bus to the village and yet another 5 minutes shuttle to the village.   Quite a well preserved village where people still live in the houses.  We also watched the face mask performance. As with many Korean sites,  there are not many information in English and we missed the shuttle back to the main bus terminal.  Do pay attention to the timing of the limited buses."
"Great day out from Andong We took the bus from just in front of the Andong railway station (opposet side of the road), paid the standard fare and were there in about an hour. Tickets bought we would advise having a look at the mask museum first to avoid any back tracking. Around the museum there are a few shopa stc and toilets. We then took the free shuttle to the edge of tha village. We chose not to hire a mobility type scooter as we felt we needed a walk. You can spent at least a couple of hours just walking around the village, popping into the open houses. We had a our picnic lunch (brought from Andong) on the banks of the river. We were told that the ferry across the river was no longer in operation so we did not get the village view from the other side. We stayed to watch the mask dance which is just outside the village , had a drink. did a bit more walking before catching the bus back to Andong. If you catch the bus from near the maks festival theatre you are more likely to get a seat.Gresat day out in wonderful sunny weather."
AMAZING This folk village is simply beautiful. Surrounded by the river the place is well preserved and is authentic. We just simply loved walking around this village.

"Excellent Preserved Village Unlike many other sites of this nature this one has no cast of simulating performers. This is a real historic village but it is lived in by modern day people. The houses are authentic: traditional mud stucco, with thatched roofs denoting the lesser villagers and tiles denoting the wealthy. The Sth Koreans have managed visitor access very well. You park and then travel in by bus. There is a museum paying tribute to a noted citizen and a cultural performance which had the native language speakers in stitches. We don’t normally go in for fake “cultural “ shows for tourists but this was more along the lines of the old English style mummers plays put on by travelling troupes of entertainers."
"A look at Korea's past Andong Hahoe Folk Village is the place to go to see how Koreans lived in the past. The village is quite big and it's easy to lose your way even with maps provided. If you are in the area, it's worth a visit. They do have scooters for hire."
"Worth a visit, very pretty countryside As with a lot of tourist places in Korea, theres a fair bit of guess work involved in where to go and best place to park up. This village is no different, if you want to avoid a lengthy walk from the car park, just keep on passing the car parks on the right until a parking official indicates you can't go any further.This village is a residential place and only residents can get their cars all the way in. Us tourists have to go on foot or buy a cheap travel ticket at a glass kiosk about 100 meters walk from the last car park. There you can jump on a pink single decker bus that will take you into the village. Otherwise its about a 1km walk.Inside you can opt to wander around by foot or hire a 2 seater electric bike or a 5 seater electric buggy. Take the buggy the Trikes are dog slow.There are many small shops selling handy crafts and tourism trinkets. There are a few cafes and restaurants. On an evening during Mask Festival there is a fire works display by the river, starts at 7pm ish. We didn't hang around but those that did told us later it was a good event.Its a place worth going to but I doubt I would go back."
"Andong Hahoe Folk Village This village gives a snapshot of the lives of the people in the early days of the Korean history. You will need to spend at least half a day to cover most part of the village/ Ancient cultural highlight of South Korea This is why you decide to get off the Soul to Busan route.  Andong is a cultural gem, and being an ancient city, the food everywhere you eat is AMAZING.  Hahoe Village is the number 1 attraction, and a perfect visual example of eastern style flow and harmony.  Thevillage is amazing, and features one house that has been lived in continuously by the same family going back almost a millennium.  Fair warning, go early to avoid the traffic!"
"Beautiful village, to bad about all those scooters This traditional village is UNESCO world heritage and it's easy to understand why. This village takes you back in time and shows lots of traditional houses from an era that has long since passed. Hahoe truly is a beautiful village situated in gorgeous natural surroundings, but it is very touristic.Personally I really didn't like all the tourists riding on electric scooters through this otherwise peaceful village. The experience would be way more authentic without those scooters. I also had some doubts when seeing some of the modifications made by the inhabitants (clearly visible air conditioning and satellite dishes)."
"The top place to visit while in Andong The Village offers a lot of historical homes and grounds to visit.  Also the site of the Mask Museum, which is worth the time to include in the visit.  It's a little confusing about bus returns to town, but everyone there is very helpful.  We bought a beautiful mask at one of their shops."
"Fantastic great stroll around this folk village with traditional houses that people still live in, plus seeing Korea from long ago What to say..."
"Just another folk village, like we have seen so many in every town. The bus ride was fun, and at least we were able to visit the mask museum and the mask dancers once we were there."
"Bof I was rather disappointed ..., you do not know if it's a museum or a real village ... for my part without much interest, even if it's still pretty."

Outstanding historic village Great place to feel the old traditional Korea like hundreds years ago. The village is full of elegant and pretty old houses. Must see World Heritage site.
"I had the best time ever I had the best time ever in this village. I would definitely recommend this place to visit and to stay. It is beautiful, serene, historical, cultural and all the delicious food!"
"Marvelous Very very nice place for a lazy stroll on a cold January morning. At least, that is how we did it. Not another single tourist insight, we saw some when we left after having been there for two hours.No glamour here, but authentic 18th and 19th century houses and people living tradition. I can imagine this place is buzzing with activities in the warmer months."
Beautiful scenery from the top I visited Hahoe Folk Village for the first time. Quite nice. When you reach the top you can see the village which surrounded by a river and looks like a small island. Its very beautiful scenery and the view from the top is amazing. Maybe more beautiful if spring time.
Fantastic village!
"Amazing old town which listed in world heritage, hidden in the mountains surrounded by river. You should make an effort to climb up to Buyongdae to overlook the village first. Better be on a tour with a guide since the village is far away from Andong-si and more interesting to know the history."
"Lovely village, if rather overrun by tourists We took the bus 246 from the train station (the tourist office at the train station will give you maps and bus times). One ticket  (5000 Won) gets you entry to the village and the mask museum and the mask dance. Pick up a map from the tourist office after buying the ticket and then a shuttle bus takes you 1 km to the start of the village. The village is lovely to wander around and (when we went) there were several houses where you could go into the grounds and see inside the courtyards, but only the Youngmorgak exhibit hall was open to see an interior (and that was modern). But wandering among the houses and narrow lanes is charming (despite the crowds) and once away from the centre the crowds thin out. We went across on the ferry (another 4000 Won return) for the view of the village from the cliff, which we thought was worth the expense (and the climb).  There is not much food and drink on sale in the village itself - the only food-selling cafe we found could not provide the cheese toast offered on the menu. There are food stall on the outskirts on the village - but it is a long way back. The masked dance was great - they offered us a programme in English that described the dances and a giant screen showed the dialogue  'surtitles' in English. Some of it was quite 'earthy' - but all good fun. The masked dance is supposed to take place Wednesday-Sunday (March to Dec). We wanted to go to Byeongsan Academy but the buses are not very convenient and its about 4km walk. The Mask Museum is OK - particularly if you are interested in masks from around the world - but we didn't spend more than 40 mins there (the museum cafe is nice though) and the 246 bus stop is right outside."
"Not worth the trip; do not stay at minbak Yes there are old houses in a pretty location but it does not look very pretty. It seems they do not really care about the total picture and as a result it looks more like a very dusty village. 50k won for 1 night in a minbak (not even breakfast included) felt like a rip-off. Furthermore there are plenty of Hanok villages around the country. So, not worth a detour for this specific one Worth a trip This village, with many people still living in it, gives me a sense of Korean old architecture. An excellent folk musical and theater performance in an open theater near the village entrance."
"#Throwback You dont see many of such things in the city.So this was a nice change of scenery.lots of green, very relaxing Serene A few nice buildings in this sleepy village and a nice setting on the river between hills and cliff. The interesting part is that the village isn’t just a tourist attraction but is still inhabited (also meaning that many houses are off limit). Worth a visit and a quiet stroll  but maybe not a large detour."

A rare glimpse into folk history.
"The devestating effects of the Korean War has for a significant part destroyed much of Korea's traditional folk heritage but one village remains proud and strong, that is the Andong Hahoe Folk Village.  It is real treat to see an entire village intact and kept pristine by forward thinking constituents and the local administration.  There is much to see and experience here for the very first time. Its a bit of a travel from Seoul but definitely worth the trip."
"Interesting Heritage Village I visited this village as part of a tour group.  Be sure to pick up the pamphlet with a guide map and photos and descriptions of village highlights.  I would recommend to bring a hat and sunglasses and to wear sunscreen on sunny days since there is not much shade.  There are restaurants, gift shops, and the mask museum by the parking lot.  After buying our admission ticket, we boarded a shuttle bus for a short ride to the village where we explored the village on foot.  In the village, there are public washrooms and a few souvenir shops."
"This village i original and not constructed for tourists We spent 6 hours at the village, checking out the houses, small streets and relaxing beneath the trees by the river. A river almost surrounds the village Hahoe ( Ha meaning water and Hoe meaning river). Many of the houses have been preserved and the same families have lived here for 600 years. There is an avenue of trees where you can sit and shelter from the eat of the day. From this area there is a bat that crosses the river and you can climb a cliff that overlooks the village."
"Would give Good if it existed Hahoe was high on my list to visit in Andong and we went there straight from the bus station after leaving our luggage in lockers. It was quite a pfaff - you have to get a ticket then get back on the bus to get to the entrance as private vehicles are not allowed nearby. The village is very pretty and the architecture from different periods were interesting. When we went, it wasn't too busy with tourists so it was nice to wander around at our leisure. One thing which was annoying was some buildings which were marked on the map and which we were told are open were locked when we were there so we couldn't look in. Also there didn't seem to be ferries available to go across to the cliff where you could have a view of the village. Not all buses from the station to Hahoe go to Beongsan Seowon so we didn't manage to get there which was a shame. As we had visited Yangdong Folk Village in Gyeongju 2 years ago and loved it, Hahoe didn't seem as impressive. It's structures are more spread out while Yangdong felt more compact. A must-see in Andong but alot of travel planning is required if on public transport to ensure you can fit everything you need in a day. (PS Don't bother with the tourist info office at the bus station- I was given all the wrong info besides the bus numbers to Hahoe and into town. The TI outside the train station is the one to go to and has the necessary bus timetables.) Nice peak into an old Korean village The village itself was not very impressive as it was mostly composed of private houses and a few open houses with nothing much to see. The small museum for Seoae Ryu Seong-Ryong was definitely working visiting by the way. There aren't that many relics to see but the history associated with the Japanese invasion of Korea was fascinating."
Lovely excursion A wonderful two hours walking around this antique village. We came late in the day and the setting sun brought out a beautiful array of colors. The houses are authentic and old and the scenery is wonderful. Well worth the visit for a view of old Korea.
Loved this beautiful yet historical Folk Village Finally made it to this beautiful and historical Folk Village. It is a live village where people are still residing. Lovely walk about the village with beautiful scenic view of the place.
"it's good if youre lucky The area itself is nice and scenic.However, there are way too many things I did not enjoy. Parking lot is pretty far from the village and you have to take a bus to get there(unless you're willing to walk a few kM). The buss is not accessible at all! Good luck getting in if you're disabled or with a baby. We went there during a school visit so it was crawling with loud kids. To top it all many people live in those houses and that spoils the historic feeling of the place. I feel like it's one of those places that get spoiled by too many tourists."
GO OUT OF YOUR WAY TO SEE IT!!!
Easy to get to from Andong and VERY worth it!  utter charm Take the bus from the bus depot in Andong.  The village is magical and try not to miss a mask dance!!
Dine This is a nice traditional Korean village. It costs 5000KRW/adult to enter. There is very little to really see or do there other than just have a quick walk around and it seems like a pretty long journey from Andong to bother going. I wouldn’t visit again if I was given the chance.

"Throwback Tour This UNESCO World Heritage listed location is a throwback to a bygone time where the pace of day to day life was definitely slower.This rural village is representative of an era of Korean history with it's beautifully preserved buildings and village layout which are amazing to wander around and view in their original states.As a city dweller, I find it fascinating that people are still able to live here in this semi-secluded community in their ancient structures, some of which still feature straw roofs - it's definitely a more simpler life.Come and pay a visit, the village is beckoning to the simpler you..."
Traditional Village - nice walk Slowly walk through this traditional wood village. An interesting history belongs to this place.Hopefully the sun will stay out.UNESCO site.
"Beautiful village The village is set alongside a winding river. There are lovely walks through the village and especially along the river.There is a lot to see in the village but unfortunately, we had limited time there."
Authentic view into Korea's past We came here as part of a tour and I found it very enjoyable. We saw vegetable gardens and rice paddies. Also walked around old-style buildings in which people are still living. To cap it off we also saw a wonderful live show of traditional performers.I very much enjoyed this tour.
"A lovely winter afternoon I went here many years ago when I was still in school but went here today. Being a very cold winter day, it was very quiet, and it felt like we had the whole place to ourselves! It meant however that most of the shops were closed, but we spent a good few hours wandering around and seeing the beautiful traditional Korean architecture. It's well worth the UNESCO heritage tag - it can be hard to get to but it's a good experience."
"How Korean families lived in the past The Hanok village is much more authentic than the one in Seoul. Since centuries the Ryuk Family lives here in traditional houses and gardens. Now some 200 to 300 people still live here. In fall you can find a lot of Kaki trees with orange fruit on leafless branches. And schamanistic influence can be observed. The location inside a big turn of the river is appealing, but do not expect too much."
"Worth a visit Lovely authentic Korean village devoid of any modern structures. A good place to walk around for several hours or stay a night in one of various authentic korean B&B. Cost from $40 to over $209. A gorgeous place at sunrise or sunset Tremendous authentic village, best we have visited This without doubt the best authentic village we have seen. The fact the people own and live in the house gives it more life and meaning. It's incredibly well laid out and almost too picture postcard but it is a living, breathing village which is a UNESCO world heritage site and I can completely understand why.We had a guide take us all around so you then get to really understand the history and importance to Koreans.Without doubt somewhere you should visit if possible.  We went mid week and it was not too busy but I would expect public holidays and weekends are a very busy busy period and to be avoided if possible...In summary, first class a must see..."
Authentic village Time travelling while walking on the village small roads. Interesting views and houses. Nice view of the river.
"Best to visit in spring and autumn UNESCO world heritage korean folk village. Situated in Andong, kyongsangbuk-do, South Korea. Surrounded by mountains. As most of the houses in the village are privately owned and still residents are living in them, you'll  have just to walk along the lanes across the village. Surrounding environment is beautiful. Paddy feilds and farmlands. Recommend to visit in spring or autumn.Transportation# Nearly 40 mins by bus (bus no:46). Take the bus in front of Andong express bus terminal."

Great scenary One of the 'must see' points in Andong. You can rent a bike for couples or for family so that visiting the village becomes more funny and easily.  Don't forget to take a short boat trip (3000 won/px for round trip) to Buyongdae where you can view the overall view of Hahoe Village which is so wonderful.
"Insight into Korean Heritage This is a ""must see"" when visiting Andong, South Korea.  The village is a visit into Korea's past and lets you appreciate the simple, yet interesting, lifestyle in the interior of the country.  This UNESCO site will allow you to relax while enjoying sites, food, drink, and fun!  TIP: try the local apples, chicken, and soju (Korean alcohol) with their own flavors!"
"Not a lot to see We were quite disappointed to find the various buildings either unfurnished or closed off. Most travellers come to Andong to see this folk village. It would have been better if the buildings had been set up internally to show how life was long ago (which was portrayed so well in Suwon Palace, just outside of Seoul). There is a high up viewing point (rock) in the area reached by a private (chargeable) ferry followed by some walking up, but you would need a fair amount of time to do this and we came for the village not the view. We only stayed for an hour, caught the early bus back and had an enjoyable tour of the Beonjeongsa temple in the afternoon. In hindsight we would probably have given Andong a miss if we had known more details in advance about the folk village."
"Interesting place to visit This is unique place to visit where you can see traditional houses of Korea with beautiful scenery of Andong. Plus you can have very delicious Andong food : me kernel and Andong jjimdak. You must try both if you are here Back to the Past visit with friends It was my first time to Korea and my Korean friends decided that I should experience the traditional part of Korea and also eat some of the Andong Jjimdalk (stewed chicken). We had arrived from daegu and the trip was hot and bothersome, the bus from the terminal to the village didnt come so we had to catch a taxi but after that it was smooth sailing. We arrived in the evening and had a lovely time walking around down to the river and back to our hanok stay. The village is surrounded by rice paddy fields and the scenery is beautiful. I will say that it was pretty hot and humid when we were there but Daegu was MUCH worse. The facilities in the area are very good and the Hanok itself was very modern (AC and plug everywhere). You can also rent golf carts to drive around if you cant be bothered to walk around. I only stayed one night but it was a really great time and I would love to go back. I dont know if I had a better time because I was with Koreans than I would have were it just myself but I think it really depends on your attitude and ability to adapt to changing circumstances UNESCO lowered its standards, catered for Koreans and not international visitors Hahoe is just disappointing for so many reasons.  First, it is badly organised and caters better for Korean tourists.  There is poor signage and little in English, Japanese or Chinese, the main tourist languages of Korea.  Last time I checked, the was deemed a *world* heritage site not a provincial one.  Next, don't think it's a quiet rural place for sight-seeing.  For a supposed replication of an ancient clan's village, the modern day version invites the very worst of Korea's hectic culture onto its grounds.  Too many electric carts instead of simply walking really took away from the quiet, bucolic flavour this place claims to promise.  Additionally, it is hard to get to from Andong Bus Terminal.  It's a long bus ride and the bus leaves only once an hour.  At Andong Terminal, it's made worse by not saying exactly when the bus arrives.  The bus stop is also cramped onto a narrow stretch of pavement next to the taxi rank.  That's not the best place to be stood waiting in hot or cold weather!  Lastly, the site just seemed to be one big glorified park with huts run by different entities that didn't consult the other about anything or were simply lazy.  There was poor signage explaining the houses.  There appeared to be a rather casual guest house establishment on the grounds that seemed hard for guests to locate, especially non-Koreans.  The 'ferry' that allegedly took people across the river to climb a rock that overlooked the village was nowhere to be seen when I was there (I very hot August day).  Who exactly is managing this place?  The same person who offered the bribe to UNESCO to give it its prestigious label?Queen Elizabeth visited the village once.  I shall just presume that they were more attentive, professional and cosmopolitan in the presentation of the place when she was there."
"Traditional village We came here as part of a tour. I'm sure there was a lot more to see than our tour guide showed us! We basically walked down the Main Street and looked at the outside of a few houses! It would have been interesting to see inside some houses but that didn't happen! There's an artifact museum but we weren't allowed to go in that either! There is also a performance which is all in Korean but very entertaining none the less! I think if you go on your own, it can be more interesting than if you go with a tour group."
Long trip but worth it!
"Despite the pouring rain, our trip to Hahoe Folk Village was fantastic. We loved feeling as though we were transported in time. Getting there can be a little tricky, from Andong you take the number 46 bus. We went from Samcheok to Andong and then from Andong to Hahoe, which took us about seven hours all up, so make sure you plan for a long day! From Samcheok, we got the bus to Taebaek, then we changed onto a bus to Yeongju, then onto a bus to Andong. It is also possible to get a train from Donghae (the town next to Samcheok) to Andong which is faster but the train times were really inconvenient, going at either 6:50am or 2pm. From Andong we got the number 46 bus which took about 50 minutes to get to Hahoe. Make sure you get off the bus at the last stop at Hahoe, we ended up having to walk quite a long way in the rain with our bags! We didn't have a reservation, but we're still able to stay in a Hanok (traditional house) without any problems, the owner of the house even came and picked us up from the ticket gate! It was 50,000 won for a room without an inside bathroom and 100,000 won for a room with an inside bathroom. We had an absolutely lovely time in Hahoe and would really recommend it!"
Interesting village This was a fun and scenic place to visit.  You can't go in the cottages as they are peoples' homes but you can walk the street and get a feel for an older way of life.  The wishing tree is a place where you can write a wish on paper and tie it to the fence around the tree.  Take a walk on the road along the river.  It's beautiful!  On a hot day be sure to wear a hat and sunscreen.  There is a shuttle bus from from the parking to the village.  You can walk it but it's about a mile each way.
"An overrated attraction I went to this attraction by bus 46. The bus was delayed by about 15 minutes. No English signs in the bus.Fortunately, passangers gave me a hint when to get off.Foreigners pay higher price (3 500 KRW) than locals. You have to take a free shuttle bus to the village's entrance.The most houses are closed as they are private. You can take pictures from outside. Only  two or three buildings were open. You see modern cars and satellite dishes which is not in line with the story about this village. Very limited English labelling. The whole tour lasted about 1 hour.On the way back to Andong you can get on the bus 46 in the village without the shuttle bus. The times are written on the yellow bus stop sign. The bus goes approximately every hour.Considering the journey from Andong to this village about one hour each way, I'd rather skip this attraction."

Heritage Site Overnight accomodation in this village is quite pricey for 1-2 person traveller but it's worth it for 6-8 person because it's in house unit.. Some guesthouse allowed you to cook(outsite the room off course). it's quite and peacefull at night.
"UNESCO Heritage Site Popularly known as the birth of Korea's Confucianism, this village is being preserved for its thatched-roof houses and villages. It's in a picturesque setting and quite beautiful during cherry blossom season."
"Musical skit was good, but satellite dishes and AC units, hanging clothing were bothersome We visited Hahoe Folk Village as part of a group trip. This is a World Heritage site, and parts of it were very interesting and beautiful, but we were bothered by the sight of AC units, satellite dishes and clothing hanging on the lines. There were also lots of cars parked in many of the units, and many more were under construction.  When we walked along the outer road by the water, we could let our minds wander back to the days when the village had been settled, probably arriving by way of the river.  The typical lunch was good, but for us the highlight was the skit with musicians and dancers performing.  Not sure about the meaning of the play, but it was charming entertainment."
"mediocre if you have visited other traditional village then there is nothing special about this place though the setting is very peaceful and relaxing.  We took a taxi to get here as there was no tourist info center at the bus terminal and took us a while to figure out which bus and from where to take the bus.  we paid 24,000 KRW.  the places of interest in Andong are scattered. so if you don't have a car, visiting them becomes problematic.  I read somewhere that you could rent a tourist taxi but somehow I was not able to arrange for one when we arrived at the bus terminal.  perhaps we could have had better luck at the train station where there is a tourist information center.   the train station is in downtown and has lots of restaurants close by.  the bus terminal is a little away from the city core."
"Boring trip to a messy place The village is easily accessible by public bus from Andong bus or train station (#46). Foreigners have to pay 3000 Won but unfortunately we were very disappointed. Most houses are ""private"" so owners don't you allow to enter. The rest are locked up or just messy places with a lot of garbage or other old staff. Walking around along the river is the nicest thing to do, we experienced the nicest cherry blossom tunnel all over Korea. We also watched the ""mask show"" at 2pm which was very boring and all in Korean language."
Felt Like We Were Intruding A few quasi traditional homes clustered into a village with most yards locked so nothing to see that is educational at all. The riparian setting is lovely even in early spring before the blossoms but quite far from the town - 45min by bus.
"worth a visit my visit to this Folk Village didn't disappoint. took the bus from Seoul and stayed a night at Andong city - was meant to stay at their Hanok Village but i was glad i didn't.. although a great place to visit during the day, it was mainly quiet with nobody around, even the homestay house looked empty. would probably had issue with dinner/food and things to do at night if i choose to stay overnight.nonetheless, it was a beautiful day in February when i visited.. the weather was warm, and really enjoyed walking and getting lost around the villages alone. there weren't many visitors (mostly locals), so i was in for many many beautiful shots of the village.take the bus from Andong city to Hahoe Village, once you get off get your ticket, proceed to the information centre to get your maps, bus timetables etc (staff speaks good English!), and then wait for the free shuttle bus which will drop you off at the Folk Village entrance.at the Folk Village entrance, you can either rent a cute bicycle-like vehicle or you can discover the whole village on foot. i think i took about 2hours wandering around.would definitely recommend."
A place to visit It is a really nice place. We enjoyed seeing the local Korean culture here in this village. A place worth visiting.
Great peaceful place.
"This is a great peaceful place to take your time to explore. We went on a Thursday so no mask dance, not many tourists either. We were fortunate to visit with a local who explained the buildings and layout to us."
"Worth the trip- but just This was meant to be the focus of our tour of Korea's east coast. the locals have certainly maximised the publicity of the village. It is a living, breathing modern village, with both ceremonial tea, and villagers walking around in traditional costume as they get into their modern cars. It is a lovely spot, no question, but it is both oddly commercial, yet under-developed as a tourist site. We stumbled onto the mask performance, which was well worth it, even though Korean was the only language used. It is a museum piece of a popular and historic art form, but still entertaining and an interesting commentary on traditional caste and class. The area itself is quite lovely. There's a lot of walking to do to see it all. Hahoe is served by public transport."

Stayed 1 night in one of the old Hanok Best way to experience Hahoe would be to stay 1 night at a resident there. We went to the information counter and they speak English. They recommended places for us to walk over and view and later return to them to make a phone call to arrange for 1 night stay. We paid KRW50k during winter season for 1 room that slept 3 of us. If the owner is nice like ours. She'll drive out to the main area for us to have a early dinner. The diner owner drove us back to hers. Very kind people in Hahoe. Have to try the Andong chicken dish. Awesome. Folks there sleep early so great time to plan your next move. If you rented a car. You can only drive to the house after 5pm.
Peaceful & historical Very peaceful and historical village to stroll around and enjoy the views. Especially the traditional 'mask performance' is recommended. It gives an very good inside-view on the culture and makes you think about your own!Also a very nice mask-museum and marketplace for souvenirs and good food!
Great day trip from Seoul It does take 3.5 h drive from Seoul but you see a different side of Korea. You see the countryside. It is reminiscent of Williamsburg in terms of what this area looked like 400-600 years ago.Good history.Long day but worth it.
Nice place for historical viewing you must a take a shuttle bus from the coach park to the entrance of the village. the view was fantastic with the traditional houses but most of them is the same.
"Unique Village I went to Andong and the Hahoe Folk Village to watch the traditional Korean Mask dance. Hahoe is a little out of the way, it takes 45 minutes to an hour to reach from Andong by bus, but is well worth it. It's a very picturesque place with nice walking areas. It's interesting to see the contrast between the traditional living spaces and how technology has made its way to one of the oldest villages in the country. Satellite dishes mounted on buildings that are hundreds of years old etc. The real highlight is the mask dance. You can still get a good idea of what's going on, even without speaking the language. When in Andong you must try Andong jjimdak! It is delicious and was one of my favorite meals on my trip. Jjimdak Alley, in the old market, is the best place to find it. There are several restaurants, all selling only jjimdak. They all have their own slight variations but I'm pretty sure the jjimdak would be delicious from any of the vendors here."
"Hahoe Village at Andong This village is almost surrounded by a branch river of the Nakdong. The descendents of a famous scholar Seongyong Yoo in the era of Choseon Dynasty still live there. This village is one of UNESCO natural heritages. You can stay at one of old tile-roofed houses. You should go to top of a hill called Buyongdae to look down the entire village. To get this bonus, you should pay about $2.50 to get a boat to cross a river. You can see a famous mask dance there as well."
"~~ Must Stay Overnight ~~ Most people stop by for a day visit, but the beauty of the village is best appreciated early morning or early evening once the throngs of tourists have left. The options to stay are few, and not so easy to find online, but if you can't reserve ahead of time just turn up and tell the information booth at the entrance you need a room and a homestay is all but guaranteed to be open ( there are actually lots of them, just no online presence ).You will want to spend time walking the lanes, enjoying the river, and hike/walking up the cliff on the other side to view the village from an elevated spot. The best way to view Hahoe is that you are not going to see something in particular; you are going to see the village itself... ie, just being there is what you are doing, it is not a sightseeing destination per se.Being that traditional village lifestyle is quickly vanishing in South Korea, I would encourage everyone to find a way to get to one and experience it themselves- and do so by staying overnight!"
"Unmissable Hahoe Andong Village is a nicely laid out and charming traditional village. The houses are quaint, ancient and people actually live there.In addition, everyday there is a folk show which is extremely unusual and a must see.Actors and actresses of varying ages wear masks when performing. The show is quite hilarious."
"Pleasant and picturesque This was one of my favorite places to visit during my recent trip to South Korea.  The village has ties all the way back to the 16th century.  Many houses still have tile or thatched roofs, maintaining the styles of the Joseon Dynasty.  I'm told that some Korean period dramas film their exteriors there.  On a warm day it was a pleasant walk, but there are also small vehicles to rent to get around.  Get your cameras ready."
Must visit. It's spectacular It's a live world heritage where there are original residents staying there.Managed to catch the International Mask Dance Festival and fireworks on 8th October night.It's pleasantly walking in the village to understand the culture and traditions of Koreans.Highly recommended.If possible stay one night there in their hanok. Deeply immerse yourself with the environment.

"Nothing happening at this open air museum Yes, okay, it is a UNESCO heritage site. But it is also 1 hour away by public transit bus #46. So that is 2 hours of your day gone, and if you are only in Andong for 1 day, that is significant.Sorry,  but this place is nothing special. You walk around a village where you can't even go into most of the houses. I appreciate that the houses are traditional, but there was just nothing happening. Perhaps it was because the Andong Mask Festival was also taking place, but I would rather have spent my time there. They should have at least had activities going on to make it more interesting."
"Traditional firework during mask-dance-festival We came to Andong exclusively for the Andong mask-dance-festival which proved to be a very good choice! (You should check the festival schedule before hand to make sure that you do not miss the fireworks!)How to get to the village:We took the bus Nr. 46 opposite of the train station. The bus ride took about 55minutes and was very crowded, so make sure you get to the bus stop on time.The village:Much smaller as the map makes one believe! We walked through the whole village in about 1h.The houses are nice and well kept with some stores hidden between them, a paradise for souvenir hunters ;)There are no real restaurants, so bring some food and water if you intend to stay longer.The fireworks:One word: AMAZINGIt was truely impressive! They had ropes stretched across the river to the rock. At the very beginning these were lit and sparks/ember started to rain down (lasted throughout the entire firework).From the top of the hill burning hayballs/bundels of stick (unsure of what exactly it was) where thrown down while lanterns where let up into the sky.The whole process was constantly accentuated by recitings and rythmic cheers.At the end a regular very beautiful firework was shot into heaven.It was a truely impressive experience!!The way back:Long story short. The fireworks lasted for about 40min. The bus back to Andong took of 1,5h (!!) later! If you come by bus you have no choice but to wait! There are hardly any taxis and these are usually pre-booked, almost no chance to catch one.This poor planning is the only negative aspect of this event."
"Fantastic place - get the ferry Excellent example of a traditional village, perhaps the best such thing. Yes there is some evidence of modern life but you can't expect folk to live in the past and not have access to all mod cons.I spent a very happy few hours here, just wandering around. There is an excellent display of historical items behind one of the houses. Write a wish and tie it to the 600 year old tree in the middle of the village.I got the 7.50 bus from Andong, which meant I missed most of the crowds. Some buses also take the very bumpy track to Byeongsan Seowon, a sixteenth century Confucian academy. Check with the driver. If so, don't get off at the folk village. Stay on the bus and you'll soon be bumping along the track. It's a 10 minute stop - the bus waits - so you don't get much time but it's worth it. The bus then returns to the entrance to Hahoe. If you miss it, there is another, and better, Confucian academy the other side of Andong, called Dosan Seowon. A really very lovely place.There is a typically excellent information point once you've taken the shuttle bus or walked - an easy 10 minutes - to the village entrance. Multi language audio guides are available free of charge, although you need ID. Buggies are also available to hire but it's an easy walk around the village.If you've got the time, make sure you cross the river on the small ferry (3000 won for a return trip when I did it) and take the surprisingly easy walk to the top of the cliff, which gives stunning views over the village and far beyond. Well worth the small effort."
Scenic historic houses TIP: Rent the buggy!
"The houses in the folk village are more than a hundred years old. People still live in the houses so it is a functioning village. At the entrance, there are some restaurants and you'll have to take a bus in after purchasing tickets to enter the actual site.We chose to rent a golf buggy for 40,000 won (1 hour) to tour the place because we had elderly parents and a baby. Others chose to tour the area by foot. There are many scenic areas for phototaking or just to relax.At one area, there are two wooden swings which you stand on to swing and a see saw where you jump on instead of sit.All in all, it's a worthwhile attraction."
Beautiful location/Great Mask Performance Go on a Wednesday or on a weekend and see the mask performance.  Just walking around is very restful - you can make a wish at Shaman Samsin's 600 year old tree.  Wonderful example of Joseon architecture for yangban and ordinary houses.  Excellent Mask Museum.  Well worth visiting.  It is easy to go on your own on a local bus.
"Nice visit to this historical town Got there on Monday, I think the slow day. They did not do the mask-dance performance. I think they take Monday off.  That was the only day we had to go and so, we missed that. In addition, many of the shops were also closed. But, DO rent the electric scooter for the self-guided tour. If you walk it and it's hot, you won't like it nearly as much and you'll likely miss some since you'll be exhausted. If you want to get more out of it, do an overnight homestay at one of the houses inside."
"Worth the visit Well preserved, and very authentic. It is worth the visit, but you will have seen it all after a 1-2 hour stroll through the village."
"Unique experience If you're travelling from Andong, you can get the Nr 46 bus from the town centre just opposite Home Plus. The journey there takes over 40 minutes. Once you've arrived, make sure you pick up a map of the village from the tourist information centre (it's not 100% accurate so beware!) You can hire a two-seat mobility scooter for KRW 20,000 an hour - initially, we thought it was preposterous but soon saw the appeal of a motorised vehicle.We visited on a particularly hot day in August: we arrived before 11am and had to wait until 2pm for the mask dance. Quite a lot of time to kill once you've seen all the key buildings and sights - it was too hot for us to get the ferry across and climb the cliff. There is nowhere in the village to hide from the heat in an air-conditioned place or get a meal.If you're going to the mask dance, get there early to secure a decent seat.Even though the bus was half-empty on our way to the village, it was absolutely rammed on our way back in the afternoon: consider getting to the bus stop early or prepare to stand for 40 odd minutes, squashed and slowly stewing!"
"Original Korean Village We enjoyed visiting this place. Andong Hahoe Folk Village is one of the preserved korean village in which real-families actually live here. The atmosphere is different and you can feel how old-time korean people actually spend their daily life.There is english speaking free tour guide near the information map that explain the history behind this place. However, he/she will not accompany us to sightseeing.In summer, don't forget to bring shades, umbrella etc, because it will be very hot and sunny.Expect to spend between 1.5hrs ~ 3hrs to explore the whole area. Check the shuttle bus schedule before you start exploring!"
World heritage Unesco An unique place in Korea which shows the roots and the way of life of the Koreans. In our opinion this is 'a must' if you're in Andong. Take enough water with you if you are visiting in the summer time because it can be very hot and there are no drinking options nor shade.

"The best ancient city in South Korea Korean culture of the best Chinese influenced village. The in depth of Asian culture deep from the old time scholars' education program. By going to the school in the village, you will see how the setting in 15th-16th century that depict  the scholar's life style, How the poems created by the surrounded river with the mountain. The mask dance is the high light of the village trip, the traditional structure with the hay roof is 300 hundred years earlier than the one in Japan."
"Beautiful Place, but..."
"Hahoe Folk Village is a very beautiful village. Walking along the neighbourhood and watching these ancient houses and the background sceneries really takes you back to the ancient times.Unfortunately, that's all that you can do because all these houses are privately owned, and not open for public. So you cannot go into any of them and see what it's like inside. Unlike many other ""old house"" tourists' attractions I've visited before. I think only one here that has an opened gate so you can take your photo at the yard.Must say I am rather disappointed considering I've travelled 3 hours from Seoul to get here and went through the ""grand entrance"" at the front (including the shuttle bus service): just for walking around the neighbourhood."
"Andong Hahoe Village This is a traditional village from the Joseon Dynasty (1392-1897).The village maintains old architectural styles that have been lost because of rapid modernization and development in South Korea. Aristocratic tile-roofed residences and thatched-roof servants' homes preserve the architectural styles of the Joseon Dynasty.The village is an excellent portrayal of traditional Korean way of life. We visited in April and the cherry blossoms were in bloom and this provided a lovely delicate touch of colour to the pictures. You also have an opportunity to stay overnight in some ""Hanoks"" / family guesthouses. One can explore the narrow streets while viewing the different Hanok houses, some which have thatched roofing while other had tiled roofs."
This is a quaint village. With BMWs in the driveways.
"This is a fine day trip - but you must go with a tour guide as it's a maze. There were a few cool things to see, like a 600 year old fertility tree. You have to take a bus to the site from a little tourist area filled with restaurants. The fish - offered everywhere - is quite good. It's weird to tour a ""commercial"" village - like Williamsburg, where people still live. You peer over walls as you walk. And you notice every villager has an amazing car."
"Disappointing While the village looks traditional it is hard to overlook the satellite dishes, cars, tractors and coke machine you will see throughout the village. I realize people live there but was expecting a more authentic experience."
"Traditional houses These traditional houses of the Joseon Dynasty are a tourist drawcard.  You park and then catch a shuttle bus to the entrance to the village.  The families living there are very accommodating to having large groups troup through their lovely little streets, but protect their privacy (deservedly so), so there is no chance to see inside any of the homes.  You can enter a couple of courtyards to see how the set up is.  The narrow laneways are cute, as are the ridiculously low gateway entries (I am very tall, so entering would have been quite funny).  There is a tree where you can write a ""hope"" and place there.  There are some good restaurants back where you first parked, so make sure you have some lunch there before you continue with your sightseeing!"
"A lovely insight of Korea's past This was a really picturesque visit, the houses were unique and is set in a perfect location. We went here in mid May and it was seriously HOT and walking around this sight was sometimes a little hard to bare but it was worth the sweat. I must confess and I know I really shouldn't compare but I just have to say it... I much prefer the old village of Shirakawago in Japan than Hahoe (I've said my piece).So just some info on how we got there from Seoul...We took the Seoul Subway Line 2 to Gangbyeon Station, took exit 4 and Dong Seoul Bus Terminal is directly opposite. As soon as you arrive at the terminal, there is a ticket counter on the left... and just ask to go to Andong (at the time it cost about 15,700 won each). If your only going for a day trip, I would advise to go as early as possible as the Bus journey is about 3 hours (with a 15 minute rest).Outside of Andong Bus terminal, there is a taxi stop directly opposite and in front of that are rows of seats where you need to wait for bus number 46 (don't stand at the bus stop round the corner of the bus terminal, like we did because bus no. 46 drives right pass you).  Bus times to Andong are - 6:20, 8:40, 10:20, 11:25, 14:05, 14:40, 16:00, 18:10. Journey takes about 40 odd minutes and the fare was 1,300 won. The bus drops you off at an area where you have to buy the tickets to the village, the fee was 3,000 won. There is an informatin desk there, where you can get a map of the area and bus times back to Andong bus terminal. Then a free shuttle bus takes you straight to the entrance of the village (literally takes about 5 mins or less). Once there you can take a short or long course around the village and if you want a bird's eye view of the place, you can get a ferry to Buyongdae cliff (which only operates at the weekend and holidays only.. I think it cost about 3,000 won each)."
Hanok must have The Hanok Village is a cultural must see if you visit Andong. It is a very important kind of korean history. Only thing we missed is a view to the Inside of the very nice Houses. You can walk there for hours or sit on the romantic little lake.
"Walking around folk museum - lacks real highlight - probably great for locals The place is nice, weekends really busy. You park your car and then walk around 30 or so houses. Most of them are cxlosed or when open, you can stand in the court, but houses are closed. Actually, the few houses we visisted, none was ""open"".There is a museum on Ryu Prime Minister (Nr 9). Thats worth to see. And also a 600 year old tree, which is apparenlty carrying holy spirits for women who have a fertility wish.The place is really important for Koreans and foreigners like me find it a bit simple, but for locals its a source of explanation where the nation Korea is founded upon."
Very nice place We visited there for half day. Beautiful village. We walked all over the place and between the allys. Nice coffee shop near the playground.

Charming - but beware Monday closing!
"The village is delightful, and really evokes a traditional Korean way of life. There are glorious, photogenic scenes at every turn, and the early cherry blossom when we were there added a delicate touch of colour and fragrance. We stayed overnight Sunday-Monday and had intended to spend the Monday morning taking the ferry across the river to climb the cliff on the other side, looking round the exhibition of photos from the (British) Queen's visit in 1999 and watching the masked dance performance - but none of these was operating on the MOnday (the dance is on Weds, Fri, Sat and Sun only in summer, weekends only in winter, couldn't tell you about the ferry - there were no signs and no answer when we rang the number written on the pier; and the QEII exhibition closed for renovations). Also bear in the mind that only snacks and drinks are available at the village itself - be sure to eat near the Mask Museum before getting on the shuttle bus to the village. The walk from the Museum to the village involves some rewarding views and only takes about 25 minutes, so worth considering if you've just missed a shuttle bus."
"Hahoe Village Very much enjoyed the tranquil visit, it seems as if modern life is still trying to catch up!!! Well worth the trip and a few hours spent strolling leisurely around this peaceful vullage!"
"Lovely little Korean village This place is gorgeous, I think we must have come on an excellent day as the sky was clear blue and the leaves were just turning so the whole thing made for amazing photo oportunities. The actual village is small and quiet-there is lots to explore-walking around on all the different routes-you can stick to just the village or you can explore up to the hill area where I think there was a temple or something that people went to go check out. Really picturesque place and highly recommended. I would go early as you can do it all in one day easily if not less."
Old Korean Village....
"Hahoe Village is one of the UNESCO sites in Korea. There are villagers residing in the traditional hanok houses. Was there with the tour group, just took walk around the village. Very quiet and comfortable. The village is surrounded by the river that coils around it, serving as a natural protection. There are two rows of cherry blossoms but as we were there during winter, could not experience the beautiful blossoms. Though it was another winter experience for us. The guide shared that it will be good to visit during March/April when the cherry blossoms. There are guesthouses in the village."
The plcae to see  old architectural styles of Korea.
"We had rather high expectations for this living village but living village is not a museum so there are pluses and minuses of exploring place like that. Hahoe is a clan-based traditional village from Joseon dynasty. There are still 230 people living there. Some houses have ceramic roofs, others thatched roofs and many are very pretty. There is a Presbyterian church on the outskirts of this village. Small businesses cater to the tourists. The most typical souvenir from this lovely place are wooden masks which reflect local traditions. The location of this village is lovely and it is a great place to walk and explore in detail. If you have time go across the river and hike the popular mountain trail.We came by our rental car and had to park in a specific location from which we reached the village via shuttle bus. Some people come by public bus from Andong.Overall I probably expected this World Heritage site to be a kind of skansen but it is still a viable village and as such it protects the rights and privacy of its inhabitants."
Thought It Would Be Much More...
"This is really a fairly large old village, with ""old Korean style"" homes...many turned into guest homes for overnight guests. No real restaurants or a place to have a bite to eat...except at the place you are staying.Wear sneakers or comfy shoes as there is Much walking involved. Mostly dirt roads, nice view of a stream/small river on the outside boundary of the village. Some homes are quite lovely...some rather run down with neglect and no caring at all. Pretty much like everywhere in the world  :)Little to do but walk the streets. EVERYTHING is pretty much closed by 6PM.Allow no more than one day."
No wonder it's World Cultural Heritage - stunning!
"From Andong City, the village can be easily reached either by public bus transport, a taxi or your own car.This pictoresque village is surrounded by a coiling river with a cliff opposite of the village on one side, and completely forrested mountains on all other sides.Picture thatched traditional buildings, and upperclass dark tiled residences, surrounded by lush green rice fields until the mountains take over the horizon.The only thing disturbingy modern, were residential cars parked here and there. Other than that, it's not hard to feel you've stepped back into time for a bit. There are three walking routes stipulated to take; a 1 hour, 2 hour and 4~5 hour tour. There is a traditional wooden ferry boat that can take you across the river, where you have the possibility to visit an ancient pavilion and temple, as well as stand on the cliff-side with an amazing view across the Hahoe village.It's highly recommended to go during the Andong Mask Dance Festival, because you will be able to have unique cultural experiences of the traditional Hahoe Mask Dance there. As tourists, I was among just a handful Westerners in between a crowd of Koreans. It was an authentic experience."
Really nice!
It is a nice opportunity to see how traditionell houses look like.You can walk around and enjoy. Try to get there in the morning during the week because then it is not that crowded...You can get an excellent view from above visiting kind of a stone plateau next to the village. You will see it. Ask locals how to get up there. But you should use a car...Visit Andong in October. Best time beause of colourful leaves. Beautiful!
Must visit!
"Hahoe is a beautiful ancient village. You can go there by bus, it only takes 3 hours from Seoul to Andong."
"Spend a Day at Hahoe Folk Village We arrived some time round 3 pm and checked in into hanok stay in this village. Everything here is totally authentic.  I can smell the wood fires burning to heat up the floors. We went walking around the village.  We had 'pak bin su' desert at the cafe nearby the pine trees at the edge of the village.Later we took the boat across to climb up Byeongdae Cliff.  it was 450 step hike, which is easy peasy for Koreans, not for us though, but it was well worth the hike.Beautiful views of the village and the river surrounding the village.  Later we walked around the village further up and found some traditional games including traditional swings.Spend a day here to enjoy walking around watching the villagers at work and see many types of vegetations of sweet potato, sesame, peanut, etc.You can dine here as well. We had a set of salted mackerel dinner with some Korean side dishes which was really tasty and only costed us 30,000 Won.  We bought some peaches here too.  It was really tasty."

"must see lovely authentic korean folk village, i enjoyed seeing it was quite less touristic than i would expect it to be. kids loved visiting it Travel back in time!"
"Hahoe is a beautiful village that preserved traditional houses (""hanok"") from 1800s -- and it's a 'live' village because people still live and work in the village. My family spent a night here and we loved how we could spend time looking into houses and visiting unique alleys at dusk and dawn. We also had a glimpse of quintessential crops that Korean farmers grow. It is a not a huge village so 1/2 day is enough to look around. There is a traditional mask dance ('tal-choom') at 2pm every day (when weather permits) and you don't want to miss it."
If you want to walk and feel the scenery of Korea...
"I recommend this place if you wanna walk and see some Korean style of houses, which are called Hanok.I saw some of houses keep remodeling and it was a little bit funny for me when I passed by some houses have modern style skylife. Lol (but it means this place has Korean own original beauty and modern style both. Because some people are still living in the town :) )If you wanna visit here, summer might be better!"
"Not so big as i thought Originaly i planed to stay here 2 nights. It had been too much, it was just a fortune ( overbooking accomodation in the village ) , that we've been only one. It's enought.1/Remember that: it's not allowed to drive in during the day. You should ask transportation from your host. Or there is a bus running between the parking lot and a village, but it's not a good solution if you've got baggages!2/Other point is the dinner. Not too many houseowner prepair dinner for you and no any restaurant is in the village! You should go out (3km) to the main entrance=parking area , where you can find some eateries.3/all these old houses are very basic, not a five star hotel 😀 Definitely Authentic We arrived at Hahoe Village at noon, so we went for lunch at one of the restaurant near to souvenir stalls and it was amazing. You have to try their salted mackerel since it is Andong speciality. The village itself was huge and surprisingly quite. We had fun strolling around the village, watching locals doing their everyday life and grab famous Hahoe handmade mask to bring  back home."
"An authentic village to experience At Hahoe Village, there is the area by the parking lot of ""village"" restaurants and the museum which may not be so differentiated. But the walk or shuttle ride to the ""real living part of the village"" is worth the visit.  You can walk along the path next to river and you will arrive to a village, of houses, rice paddies, and some ""hanoks"" family guestahouses.  This part of town is quiet and no real restaurants - all closed around 6 pm.  so it is more to walk, relax and just ""hang out"".  We took early morning walks and were able to find some of the historic landmarks which were open to explore.  For us it was worth staying in the village to enjoy an ""escape""."
"Authentic traditional Korean folk village Having previously visited the reconstructed and highly commercialised village in Jeonju, it was a treat to visit this more authentic, UNESCO listed World Heritage site. We spent an enjoyable couple of hours exploring the narrow streets and viewing the different Hanok houses, some with thatched roofing, others tiled. This village is constructed along geomantic lines and since the 16th century has been inhabited by one clan, the Ryu.  Many of the original buildings have been preserved and various folk arts are still practised. One of these is the Hahoe Mask Dance, a traditional shamanic rite. Unfortunately it was cancelled on the day we went, as a precautionary measure due to the MERS outbreak. However, there were various other hands-on activities available  such as weaving, turning of stone grinding mills and the chance to balance a stone pot on your head. Don't miss the Mask Museum, located near the Tourist Information Centre outside the village. Set on two floors, it hosts an impressive collection of masks from all over the world.Finally, a tip for anyone driving here and using Korea's only English language GPS. If searching under 'tourist attraction', key in 'Hahoe folk village'. We made the mistake of searching for 'Andong Hahoe Traditional Folk Village' and ended up at a modern, reconstructed outdoor museum about 30 minutes drive from Hahoe village itself."
"nice place I visted this village early in the morning it was very nice I spent couple of hours ,there was nobody and I enjoyed very much The best folk village in mainland Korea We literally visited every folk village in South Korea except the one on Jeju island. Hahoe folk village in Andang is the only one worth visiting and it is the only one that is real in a sense that people still do live and work in and from there. You need to stay here in one of the old homes at least for one night to truly appreciate the light and its magic during sunrise and sunset. The Tourist Information Office near the ticket office can arrange your stay.We stayed in Juil Residence, the second oldest house in the village. It was built in 1624. We paid 80KW for two people excluding any food. The owners (husband and wife team) are incredibly kind and hospitable people. We went to the performance at 2 PM with masks. It was very good and free of charge. We went around the village right before sun set and then next morning we went around before sun rise with a cup of coffee in our hand (we made it ourselves). Spectacular lighting on these adobe and straw, brick and tile, wood and brick and straw and tile and a combination of all of the above homes. The lonely, little church was precious. A place definitely worth visiting. It was the highlight of our trip when we went around all over the country. From Andang you take a bus that will take you to the entrance. You pay the fee and then your host should pick you up or if you are not staying overnight then proceed to walk about a km to the actual entrance of the village. The mask museum near the tourist office is good as well. There is not much in terms of food in the village. Everyone seems to eat dinner and breakfast at the home they are staying. We brought our food with us. On the other side of the river there are a couple of residences as well. But those are outside the village and not easy to get to by public transport."

"Nice Nice, to be done when sunny. Nice surroundings with the river. Museum for relics of Mr Ryu interesting. Best place in the village."
"A little bit underwhelmed After visiting Andong Folk Village, we felt that Hahoe did not offer many extras. Very little information is provided (both at the houses in the village and in the leaflet with the map we picked up at the local tourist information), and it was not possible to go in the buildings. The ferry across the river somehow did not go when we got there (which was a shame as there were another 3 or 4 buildings at the other side, as well as a hill to climb for - seemingly - great views on Hahoe). The scenery is quite beautiful, but the village itself feels a bit too polished and touristy.We thought it would have been good to know that in the village itself, it is virtually impossible to find anything to eat (at the official entrance, about 1 km. outside of the village there were loads of restaurants though). There are a few machines selling soft drinks, and I think there were some cafes that are usually open but not today."
"Pretty little village It's small old korean style village. Pretty but most (all) of the houses can be see only from outside, people still live in.And very cheap, only 1.000 Won."
"Not as much to see as I had hoped I was hoping to see a bit more here but most of the houses are only viewable from the outside and those that you can enter are just set up like a museum exhibition which doesn't quite feel real. As usual in Korea, the scenery was good, especially along the river. The restaurants serving the chicken hotpot were also good."
"Beautiful cultural village This was my most wanted destination for our Korea trip and the place really won the heart of my parents, despite the little long travel time needed to get to the place.We arrived at Ha Hoe just in time for the mask dance, then slowly walked to the village and found our pre-booked guesthouse for an overnight experience. That was just the right decision to feel the real village in peace at night and early morning when the crowd left, and also to experience the stay in the traditional hanok.We visited Hahoe during foliage peak time, so the village was covered in yellow gingkos, riped orange persimmons and colourful maples which made the old houses and river in the village more romantic and scenic. The rice field were just harvested.. Everything was perfect for the nature and cuture experience trip."
Understanding the past This is a very quaint old village that is now run for tourism but the ancestors of the original family along with others still live here.  Very beautiful and does not feel touristy.  We stayed for one night and got to walk around with fewer tourists around. Places like this help us understand the history and culture of Korea.
Definitely worth a visit!
"Beautiful place... Peaceful and relaxed. Nice just to amble... Spent couple of hours here. Go the opposite way to everyone else so see some of the outskirts first to avoid everybody else. Get the bus times to and from Hahoe to plan your time well. Generally, there's a bus every hour. Get to the stop early so you don't have to stand for the whole 50 min journey! There's a shuttle bus at the village you can use...get it from the car park beside the ticket office."
Beautiful even in the very cold weather!
"Though it takes a bit to get here (park, walk, take a shuttle bus and then a short walk - no big deal, but unexpected,) it is worth it to see an authentic folk village. It is interesting to see the various styles - thatch-covered housing and tile-covered houses for the more elite. We especially enjoyed the display of family artifacts in one of the buildings - try and find that as it is a warm-up opportunity as well. The adventurous can take a ferry across and climb to the top of a cliff for a view of the village."
"UNESCO World Heritage Site for Good Reason We visited Andong Village primarily to see and photograph the Traditional Mask Dance... and we were Not disappointed. If you need slick and produced like an amusement park, you are likely to be disappointed. This is authentic, real and absolutely delightful. The humor of the scenes was a learning experience about traditional Korean culture. This was a great memory of my first visit to Korea... and I would highly recommend it.The ""living village"" with the restored houses in active use was a real plus, adding to my knowledge of a traditional village. I was fortunate enough to travel with a Korean who added a deeper understanding of what I saw, and helped to place this learning in a broader cultural and historic context. While it was a bit disappointing not to see inside all of these houses, I can certainly understand the residents not wishing to give up all of their privacy for tourist curiosity.There are several food options at Andong Hahoe Folk Village, including being served in a private, traditional house. This can add to the overall experience, and is not expensive.If you have been to many small traditional Korean villages, know a great deal about Korean history and culture, this may not add to those experiences. There are a few little touristy shops, as one might expect. But Andong Hahoe Folk Village is an excellent way to explore Korean history and culture for novices.Entry now requires parking private vehicles in a parking lot, and entering the village by tour bus."
Just wonder and be - No hassle It is great to get the opportunity to see some Korean living history. Gives you a good insight as to what it was like but it is still real.Quite amazing.

"Korean beauty and tradition We had our class fieldtrip in Andong hahoe folk village and it was definitely a Korean authentic experience. As you maybe aware, this folk village is included in the UNESCO Wolrd Heritage list. It is both surprising and interesting to know that Koreans still live in this village and that there are 16 beautiful landscapes in Hahoe! My favorite ones are the 600 year old tree, buyongdae cliff and the mansongjeong pine tree forest. In addition, there is also a traditional mask dance play /performance for the visitors. (However, the whole play is in Korean.) So if you are really into Korean culture and tradition, I recommend that you visit Andong Hahoe Folk Village."
"Stay in the Village Definitly nice to visit - but make sure you spend the night i the viollage. You will sleep on the floor (very comfy) and actually enjoy dinner cooked by your host family (additional price - but very, very reasonable for a traditional Korean dinner, ate in ur ""room"" on the floor - just awesome).Next morning get up and walk the village and surrounding rice fileds- great. You will beat all the tourist buses and actually get some awesome photo ops. Have the fishcake and soup for breakfast at the outdoor stand at the village promenade for an even better experience. Buy some masks and support the village. Cheaper than anywhere else and made locally."
"An experience not to be missed N36°32.305' E128°21.099 In Korea accommodation is so numerous, that there is usually little need to book ahead, except for Han-Ok guesthouses, national holidays and weekends in national parks. Wanting to rent a room in a traditional home in Hahoe Folk Village near Andong, we asked excellent speaking tourist information staff in Andong for it: no need, plenty accommodation.We took bus #46 in the city centre of Andong opposite the Kyobo Building to Hahoe Folk Village. It dropped us off at the village gate to buy an entry ticket for KRW 3000. The bus itself continues with only locals into the village. Again excellent English speaking tourist information staff searched free accommodation with air-conditioning. Typically, Hahoe homes have only shared bathrooms. KRW 50.000 is the standard rate for two persons in one room. Gaondang (64-2, Hahoe-ri) was the first available choice and an additional free pickup from the gate to the guesthouse was offered. We were expecting a rice farmer with a pickup truck, but the owner arrived in a brand new Jaguar sedan at the village gate. With the huge number of tourist and a big parking lot, was the Jaguar sedan the confirmation of a tourist trap?Gaondang traditional house is in a less busy side street, although tourist walked through the front gate looking around the house and taking photographs of us in the house. Suddenly this felled like a game changer. No longer were we tourists ourselves, but part of the attraction. Gone was our privacy. This must be hard for residents, although tourist bring in huge amounts of money.On the wooden veranda of our room in August 2014, we took a break to endure the midday heat. From four until seven in the afternoon we strolled the village, taking many pictures from every angle of beautiful village homes and small fields with working village people. Koreans looked surprised we did not take pictures with ourselves in front of traditional homes, but those looked so nice in the afternoon sun that a selfie would spoil the scene. By the way, we did not have an obligatory selfie camera extension pole with us.We noticed several building projects in the village and some brand new homes in traditional style. A professor and his wife greeted us with a cup of rice wine. Their traditional home is their permanent resident in the village, like many others, and has a beautiful garden. Some private homes are excluded pieces of art on their own.At seven o’clock, the owner took us to another village home, converted into a small local restaurant. The woman of the house served delicious backed chicken in soya sauce with the usual gimchi site dishes. A big bottle of cold beer came to the rescue eating this hot spicy dish. We were the only guests. After diner, we enjoyed a peaceful walk back home through a silent village. Mesmerising experience.Gaonding traditional house offers six rooms with air-conditioning. Outside are two ablution blocks. One with a hot shower and one with two toilet/hot shower combinations. The hot shower was excellent, but lacked unsurprisingly adequate cleaning. The owner does not offer breakfast and there is not breakfast option in the village.In our room, we slept on the ondol floor with mattresses (about as thick as a thin futon). The next morning we took bus #46 from the gate (information from the owner, but apparently the bus starts in de village centre) to the new Andong bus terminal on the outskirts of Andong to have breakfast.Hahoe Folk Village is a tourist attraction during the daytime, but after the last 18:20 hour bus leaves the village, it becomes a real traditional village again to be enjoyed by a lucky few people. Gaonding is a good place to stay. Recommended."
"Interesting for those unfamiliar with Korean villages Hahoe is an interesting village where you can see traditional style houses lived in by everyday Koreans. While noteworthy I felt it was similar to the styles I had seen in Jeju, Jeonju and Seoul  - hence my opinion may be tainted a little. We were a little rushed for time, so took a taxi to the village from the centre of town. This cost approximately 29000krw. (its about 20km from central Andong). Buses run from the train station and they cost 1600krw and take 50 minutes to get to the village. A 2000krw entry fee gives you access to the village and a courtesy bus will take you the kilometre to the 'entrance'. The houses and lane ways provide you with a sense of what village life is really like and many of the locals will give you a wave or have a quick chat. While Andong Hahoe Village was pleasant I guess I felt that the villagers deserved their privacy, especially when the tour buses began to arrive!"
"Special spot i visited four different folk villages during my travels around Korea (in very different locations) and this was the best. While popular with visitors, it is still very much a place where locals continue their rural lifestyle and it has not become overloaded with tourist shops. It could be a cool place to do a homestay during the mask dance festival."
Confusionism Village.
"Confusionism Village.  It is really village that actually people is living.This villiage has harmoney between tradition and modern.It is family Kwon's village. You can enjoy confusionism, old buildings, pavilions.Andong is so-called capital city of sprit culture."
"Beautiful village in traditional Korean style Lovely area to make a lot of great pictures. Try to go during the week and not during a holiday, as it can flood quite easily with huge groups of tourists. No need to stay ehre overnight, a few hours to walk around is more than enough."
Nice Scenery I went on a Saturday during Mask Festival and it was nice. I sat right at the foot of the stage so I was able to get a nice angle for my photos.  The village didnt have many people in it as most of the festival was happening downtown. ..this was a much better venue for a more authentic feel.
"very nice Beautiful and well preserved village. The current residents are the descendants of the clans who lived there during the Joseon dynasty.  Some of the houses are open to view various relics from the Joseon scholars that used to live there. The area was a bit bigger than I expected and you'd probably need at least an hour there. The bus from Andong city runs every hour. The ride is about 40 minutes, and then there's the shuttle bus, which takes a few minutes and is frequent. There's eating places and shops around the entrance area. The view of the village and surrounding rice fields from Buyongdae cliff is great as well. The houses are really quaint and the flowers and trees around them are just lovely."

"Korean Traditional village This district is a Korean traditional village where  nobles called 'Yangban' lived during the Chosan dynasty.In this village, still everything is conservedas it was in Chosan dynasty.There is an entrence fee but it's nearly free around $1~3 ( for us 1, but unfortunately for u, foreigners, 3...sorry i don't know the reason.)One thing you must keep in mind is transportation is really terrible....There is a bus  route but interval is really long....so you have to be patient..hahaBut i promise u it'll be a perfect experience here.And there are many guest houses near, and inside the village   so u may stay there Korea as it once was We came here by bus from andong which takes 35-40 minutes. The village itself is very nice with multiple houses that are just precious. The prices of handicrafts are inflated but that would be expected. The only problem I see is that one never knows how much of this is reconstructed vs. truly historical a problem that is common in Korea. If you are planning a trip from Seoul to Busan and want some places to stop I would include this in the itinerary."
To see the traditional Korea A nice showcase of Korea traditional village. The area is huge and the houses are so beautiful. During the spring/ summer time you can see lots of flower blooming and exotic trees around the village.
I fell in love with this village!
It is a quiet place that still containes the scent of old times. People are still living in the houses so you might not be able to see all of the Hanok's. But the old tree in the middle is said to have been house of a God that protected the village. Do not forget to make a wish and collect it later. The tree really does have a different atmosphere around it.
"Explore the most ""Korean"" city in Korea A quiet village with many beautifully preserved traditional Korean houses, or Hanok. The village is good for exploring on foot for a few hours.There's free lockers just beside the ticket box, which are big enough to fit backpacks or small luggages.A shuttle bus ride is required from the entrance to the village. It takes a few minutes for the shuttle bus ride.At the east of the village, you can take a short boat ride (3,000krw for a return ticket) to Buyongdae Cliff (부용대) for a bird's eye view of the village. The cliff is about 64m and takes about 10-15 minutes for the climb up.For more photos, visit http://travellerelf.blogspot.sg/2014/08/traditional-andong.html It's 'Korean' !"
"This village was made in 16c, period of Cho-seon dynasty, and then, descendents have kept and managed here for last 400 years. You can see traditional house and styles, and also old village, not modern. Don't forget, you can sleep in the village, specifically in the old house buillt in 2~400 years ago. Only you can go into the village by bus, and restaurants are not in the village, but are in parking lot. Salted fish, named 'Kan-ko-deung-eo', is famous and recommended food here. At least 2~3 hours needed. Just feel calm and peace here. The scenic view on the cliff, don't miss it!!"
"The folk village is ok, but the mask dance is the best This was a picturesque village, with lots of old, traditional-looking little houses, but also with modern cars and security systems. I really wonder how people live there, and I wish I'd been able to sleep in a traditional house in Andong, but I couldn't find any booking information in English...Then I got to watch the Hahoe Mask Dance, early enough to get a front row seat. I especially chose my travel dates and itinerary in order to come to watch this dance, which takes place on weekends from 2 to 3 PM (some times of the year also on other days). There is the constant music of drums on the background, a tune which I would later hear several times while in Korea, and the different characters introduce themselves in a very expressive and funny way. It was quite entertaining.My entire trip around Korea is described here: http://ttlgawift.weebly.com/around-korea-in-15-days.html ."
"Interesting and unforgettable experience It is a historical village, around 4 hours away from Seoul by bus. If you want to get away from a big city and enjoy a moment of silent. I would highly recommend you to stay in this small beautiful village for one night as it spend times to travel. The architectures are so nice with the ancient street. You can climb up to the top of the hill and you can enjoy the fantastic view of the whole village in U-shape. One thing that you have to prepare is most of the residents cannot speak English, but you will still survive :) Historical Korea This was an interesting experience  The village is comprised of multiple dwellings that date back centuries. When an inhabitant dies, a relative is allowed to take over the property. the homes are in their original shape. There is a 600 hundred year old tree in the village that is believed to have a spirit that protects the village and it's residents."
Somehow I missed the charm . . .
"I was looking forward to this place because I'd been told it was one of the best folk villages in S Korea.  Perhaps I would have enjoyed it more on an actual tour because I didn't get much out of it.  It was a bit difficult to reach - bus to Andong from Daegu, bus to Hahoe from Andong, shuttle bus from ticket kiosk to stop outside the village.  We wandered around and took some photos, trying to get angles where no cars, electric lines, satellite dishes, etc were in them to spoil the effect.  There were only a couple of houses that appeared to be open to the public (brochures, signs inside, and so on), but there was work being done on one and were were told we couldn't go in.  The other was actually closed.  So, in short, I felt this one was a lot of trouble to access, but then we couldn't really access anything.  Would have preferred to do something else with the better part of a day that this site took."

"A real disappointment We arrived early morning at Hahoe Folk Village as recommended by lonely planet book.  On arriving at the site there is a general car park, where you make your way to the ticket office.  A bus then runs from the car park area to the village.  On arriving site most of the buildings are not for viewing and privately owned. The buildings that were open to the public were still closed (20 minutes after opening time).  Looking round the outside of the village was like walking around a new housing estate, mobile masts, satellite dishes, cars parked in driveways, a tractor running up and down a field and a modern roadway around the whole village.  I just did not get the feeling of going back in time, which I felt was a real shame."
"The Symbol of Korean Traditional This place is very peaceful and represents Korea traditional house. Once you visited this place, you would think Seoul Bukchon Hanok Village is just a miniature of Hahoe Village.Initially, I planned to stay overnight in this village to experience the Hanok stay before the trip. After advice from my friend that it would be inconvenient to find any convenient store, food especially for dinner and shopping area. Hence, we decided to stay in Andong city and took the bus into this village for 1 day tour. Taking a taxi will cost W30,000 but, the bus only costs less than W5,000. Furthermore, to my surprise that Andong city is full with all necessities that we need. Tourist Information Centre is very helpful to assist our queries which they have English and Mandarin speaking assistance.We took about 1 hour bus to reach the Hahoe Village Information Centre where they have an English translator to explain and assist us on the recommended route. There is another free shuttle bus from the Information Centre to the entrance of this village. We found a hanok within the village that was selling food. But, we had our lunch near the Hahoe Village Information Centre.Besides the traditional hanok houses, I love their cherry blossom lane that full of cherry blossom that starting to bloom during our visit.It is recommended to have a day tour to enjoy the slow pace of the environment instead of rushing from one tourist site to another tourist site within the same day. This is really worth a visit."
Visit during the Cherry Blossom season!
"A spectacular old traditional village with thatched roofs and tiled roofs from the Joseon Dynasty. Not easy to get to, but worth the journey - the community is the home of the Ryu clan. Queen Elizabeth II visited this area, well known for its traditional way of life and culture. On certain days, there is a Hahoe Mask Dance performance. In April, the rows of Cherry Blossoms are amazing. Try some of the local food - such as Andong Gangodeungeo (salted mackerel)."
"Relaxing retreat One of my favourite experiences in Korea (have been here for 3 months so far).A bit difficult to get to (Had to take an 2 hour train from Gyeongju and then a 30min taxi to Andong) but was so relaxing and peaceful. Very few places in Korea can you get such silence, particularly at night and the accommodation (although expensive) was very clean and provided a small glimpse into traditional life.Restaurants close around 7PM so be sure to bring food just in case. We were there during cherry blossom and it was spectacular !"
"A Glimpse Into the Past Unlike some of the other Asian countries we've visited, it's not very easy to find traditional Korean architecture -- so much of it was bombed into smithereens in the Korean civil war.  But this village is ONLY traditional architecture, and it's a real, populated place, with about 200 families.  It's not what you'd call an exciting place to visit, but our family (including an 11 and a 14-year-old) enjoyed 2 peaceful days there.  Mainly, we walked around in the village taking pictures and also visited some of the other traditional things in the area, such as the Hahoe Mask Museum, the traditional Mask Dance performance, and a Hanji paper-making factory.  Well worth the visit if you're interested in architecture."
"""Ignore the warnings, enter the village!"" As we approached the village we were confronted by menacing wooden poles, Jangseungs. These totemic warnings were traditionally placed at the edges of villages to mark the village boundaries and frighten away demons. Wandering around the labrynth of narrow streets of thatched, wattle and daubed huts you are transported back to dynastic and clan based Korea. As the village opened up, more elaborate and affluent homes emerged. The village is situated on a meandering river with a sheer rock face on the opposite bank. This village deserves your time, you will not be disapointed. After several hours of wandering our appetite for food took over; we ate in a traditional home, very simple and spartan but the food was excellent and the bowls of rice wine, well....."
Don't miss it  beautiful area Queen Elizabeth planted a tree there. Houses from 1500's. Beautiful river area. Oldest Temple.  Korean countryside.
Step back in time.
"Hahoe is a well preserved traditional folk village, established by the Yu clan of Pungsan during the Joseon Dynasty in the 16th century.The village is home to some truly stunning houses, belonging to the Yu clan, which maintain old Korean architectural styles. Korea has become incredibly boxy in recent years due to rapid development and modernisation, so I welcomed the chance to take a moment away from the noise, neon lights, glass and metal to see the country as it used to be; peaceful, beautiful and inspiring. Walking around the village is like going back in time, everything is as it was except for the cars in driveways and plastic toys scattered on the porches. You can't help but stand back and imagine people from years ago walking, living and enjoying their beautiful area.Hahoe was an unplanned visit, but I enjoyed every single moment of it and I truly believe you should visit Hahoe if you get the chance."
"Couldnt Feel More Traditional this place really replicates a village of the period, and best of all you can actually spend a night here. we paid about $60 to spend a night in this old couples guest room, and there are many others who do the same. now unfortunately i cant say how to do it, because everything was done through my Korean friend. but even inside the house it was very traditional, but be ware, if your tall your gonna have trouble, though i did not. (i'm 5f.10in)  The area is very peaceful, and was a stark contrast to the cities I'd visited (Busan, Incheon, Seoul)  I've never seen a village quite as large and preserved as this one. If you in the Andong area, give this place a visit."
"A Fantastic Walk Back in Time My group spent an interesting half day in Andong Hahoe Village and were not dissapointed.The village has been well preserved for centuries - the clay floors and thatched roofs reminded me of a simple but happy life when man was one with nature. Life in the village remains simple and true to its tradition, almost untouched by our modernities. A stroll along the small walkways felt so peaceful and serene as if the ancestors were wooing us along.The location in the Nakdong River Valley is ideal, fertile area and well sheltered from the vagaries of nature. The early folks certainly knew how to choose a building site. The aura of the place seem to engulf one and take you back in time.A very educational and wortwhile experience. This is one site I would recommend everyone to visit, but remember to respect the folk's privacy - no poking behind closed gates/doors."

"Very interesting to see Korean folk history Lovely spot,  very rural and peaceful (except for school kids ) but able to get away from this.  Interesting construction and arrangements of the houses together.    If time is available see the Hahoe Mask Museum and take the boat across the river and walk up Buyongdae Cliff for a super view of the village and valley."
A cultural trip into Korea's past history We stayed at the Rak Ko Jae guesthouse overnight and so could explore the village in the morning while still empty of visitors.The traditional house date back hundreds of years with some being still lived in today. The extended family that maintains the village has done an outstanding job in maintaining the Korean heritage. A visit there transports one back to the olden times and shows the Korean soul before its high tech make-over. Highly recommended.
"Good to see during the week Catch the number 46 bus from the train station or bus terminal, get off at the last stop, buy your ticket and catch the free shuttle bus to the village (1km away). Its a great little village to have a quick 1 to 2 hour stroll around. Gives you a taste of traditional korean housing and life, but you cant go into the houses. The riverside is also pretty. If you are in Andong and can spare an hour to get there and an hour to get back go see it."
"Don't Forget Your Sunblock Hahoe village is a wonderful half day experience in the Andong area illustrating the traditional Korean way of life that existed for hundreds of years before the westernization and modernization of the peninsula. However, it gets hot so bring sunblock."
"Genuine, scenic, and refreshing I've lived in Korea for three years and I can't believe I've only just visited this lovely place last month! Unlike so many of the other Folk villages in Korea, this one is a genuine historical site with people STILL living there. (So please be mindful of that if you visit). I've been to other folk villages, which were certainly fun and interesting, but they had that fake facade amusement park feel about them. Hahoe, on the other hand, is a real community, still living and farming in thatched roof houses. (Being an anthropology major, I was in hog-heaven).We went in February, so the ferry was closed, but we still had a great time walking around and there were so many great photographs to capture! And after having lived in the city so long, the mountain air was so crisp and refreshing. The view of the river and the cliffsides were enchanting too. We especially enjoyed the playground with those crazy suicidal see-saws and stand-up swings. And the prices for wood-crafts were quite good as well!"
"A fun day exploring Korean traditional life We lost ourselves all day here exploring the different areas and buildings, taking pictures, etc. We were in town during the Andong Mask Festival so it was a bit crowded, but it was a good time."
"Korea's best preserved Clan Village Since the 15th century Hahoe has been a clan village. The current layout of Hahoe is mostly a result of constructions during the 17-18th centuries, though quite a few older buildings remain. The location was chosen using Feng Shui principles, and indeed the beauty of the area is certainly a highlight. It is important to note, that the village has produced numerous important politicians during the Joseon dynasty, including a famous prime minister during the Imjin War.Hahoe can only really be enjoyed by exploring the village extensively, as you reach one corner, explore another area. The village is spread out between rice paddies in the north, from there extending to the river which nearly encircles Hahoe proper. Numerous preserved buildings remain, and the small alleyways are delightful. Caution for visitors, Hahoe has a local population that lives here, respect their privacy, most buildings cannot be entered. This means also not taking pictures of people without their permission. Hahoe and Yangdong villages, after becoming a Unesco World Heritage site receives far more visitors than it used to. Enjoy your visit here, the landscape is pleasant and visually stunning on a nice day."
"Pretty little village; but only if you have time It was a misty morning when we spent around two hours wondering around the village. It was autumn, the colours were so pretty. The glassy water on the river reflected true mountains on the other side of the village.It's great for 2 hours, but there are lots of places in Korea you can find this scenery. The houses are nice too, but not worth the journey if Hahoe is the only reason you are coming to Andong.But.... if you are here, take the path from the ticket office to the village instead of the free shuttle bus. It was a few cute little stories about the village.If you have time to kill whilst waiting for your bus back to Andong - check out the pics from Queen's visit!"
Historical village Hahoe village is a restored village. It is a historical recreation; it reminded me of Jamestown in Virginia.  The river was beautiful and there was a rice wine beverage that several of us enjoyed nearby.
"Unmet expectations After 1 hour sightseeing on bus 46, we arrived at the Hahoe village. Having seen these type of villages in various countries, I had an idea what to expect. Instead we found a number of older houses (quiet a view had been restored), but not old enough to be really interesting. None of the homes could be entered to get a glimpse of how people had lived in those early days. Very little information was given on that btw. My guess is that the visit of QE II boosted this place into stardom..."

Amazing Place!
"If you want to see how things were and how the people of Korea lived up until the Korean War, this is the place to go. This village is over 500 years old and houses traditional architecture from the Jeoson Dynasty, the last dynasty of Korea before the Japanese Occupation. It's a great place for photography and the Hahoe Mask Dance is very interesting to watch. I do suggest going during Spring or Fall as it can be very hot in the Summer and really cold during the Winter. All of the activities (including the Mask Dance) are outdoors."
Definitely the best place in Korea Only the problem is it is really far away from Seoul which takes more than 4hours by bus however you will see lots of traditional housesquite and peacefulu can ride Korean style shipalso stay a night gave me interesting memoryfor me autumn is the best season to visit Great look into traditional Korea This is the best traditional village I have gone to in Korea. It has a more authentic feeling. The farmlands around the village make you feel like you are in traditional Korea. I recommend taking the small boat to the other side of the river and climbing the small mountain/hill. It gives you a good bird eyes view of the village.
Take the boat across the river and walk up the hill for an amazing view!
"Hahoe Village is a truly beautiful and peaceful place. You can walk around between the houses for hours just looking at the pretty thatch buildings.However, make sure that you check the bus timetable and try to plan a little bit how you are going to navigate the area, giving yourself time to explore the area outside of the village itself. (NB, We didn't do this, and had to make a second trip to see the things we'd missed!)The river area for me was equally as spectacular as the village, and if you take the boat over to the other side (for an additional charge) there are a number of politically significant historical structures which were used by Korean intellectuals as places to write.Last but by no means least, once over the river you can walk up to the top of the hill, and take in the breathtaking views of the whole village area (and a wonderful photo opportunity).PS. There is a museum at the site commemorating the visit of Queen Elizabeth II; surreal for a British person to see!"
"Unique village where noble and peasant houses are mixed together You can see noble houses and also peasant houses here which is unusual because usually the noble houses are in one area and the ordinary houses are in another area.  People still live here because they receive support from the government to continue living in traditional style.  If you want to stay in the village there are a number of options, some are more basic places and there is also a very nice expensive hanok.  Near the entrance to the village is a mask museum that is worth seeing.  The buses run infrequently from Andong so be sure to get the schedule or you could be waiting a while."
"Time Travel to the Joseon Era Hahoe Village gives a nice sense of what Korea villages in the Chosun dynasty may have looked like (though all is now obviously fully restored, the roads are paved, etc.).  A welcome reprieve from the concrete deserts of the major cities.It is a tad far from Seoul, so I suggest taking 2 days to visit it together with Gyeongju."
"Lovely hanok village, too bad about the crowd The village is set by the river, it was lovely to stroll among the hanoks and take in the atmosphere. Most of the houses are occupied by residents and only a few of the hanoks are open to the public. You can either walk the 1km from the ticketing office to the village or take the shuttle bus for 1,000KRW (if memory serve me), no private transport is allowed in the village. Try to get there before the crowd."
"Amazing experience This is the most interesting place in my opinion. To me, a city in a foreign country is very much like any other cities (thanks to globalization), temples and palaces in Korea have similar features to those in China & Japan (due to shared heritage),  so this in my opinion is the most Korean. it's a very well preserved 600yo village. Walking around the village made you feel like you're walking around a movie set (for a Korean drama/movie of course!).We stayed in a hanok, one with thatched roofs. This was where I missed modernization -comfy western beds! We slept on futon placed on the floor with ondol heating system (cold at nite and early morning so heating system is necessary). The room is small, just sufficient for 2 luggages, small TV and sleeping space. There is a bamboo hanging horizontally on the wall as clothes hanger. No modern locks, just a latch (ancient type). The door and the room are covered with paper.Beyond Hahoe, it was quite difficult to go around Andong due to language barrier. Unless you are sure of where to go, taxi may be easier but communication is still limited."
"Yangjin Dang SO beautiful. Learned so much about confucianism in Korea Pleasant way to spend a day; mask dance a must see I enjoyed the experience of Hahoe village (pronounced more like “Ha-hway”), but I have to say in some respects this one was a bit over-rated by the travel guides. Given it's actually inhabited, it was not as good for photos as say Andong folk village, which is completely uninhabited. None-the-less wandering around the Hahoe village was a pleasant way to spend a day.To get there take the bus #46 which from memory departs across the road from the train station and also somewhere near the intercity bus terminal – journey is about 40 minutes (get a bus timetable and map at the information desk outside the train station). Once at Hahoe, you are free to wander around the village, make a wish at the wishing tree and for a nominal fee take a ferry across the water to a cliff where you can get a nice view of the village. The mask dance is an absolute must and by itself almost makes the trip to Hahoe worthwhile. Please carefully check the time, day and location of the performances as I noticed some inconsistency between various information sources (we attended 2pm on a Saturday) – you can always double check details at the information desk. There isn’t much food in the Hahoe village, you need to take a short shuttle ride/walk, but be sure to enjoy some mask shaped cookies while watching the mask performance."

"Hahoe Village takes you back in time When traveling to South Korea, don't miss taking a trip to Hahoe Folk Village just outside the scenic town of Andong. Catch Bus #46 from downtown Andong for an interesting 50 minute ride into the countryside. Get off just outside the village to visit the Mask Museum, an amazing collection of authentic historical masks. Then board the shuttlebus to the Village itself. You will feel like you have gone back in time to the 16th century. This is  no museum. These are real people actually living in the homes of their ancestors. Authentic old houses some with thatched roofs, some large, opulent, and impressive. Some small and homey. All currently lived in. You will see families tending their vegetable garden, growing crops for their family. Families sitting around tables on the floor sharing their noontime meal together. There is a Treasure House with old documents and antiques.The people are proud of their houses and their heritage and will actually stop and talk with you and explain a little about their village and their lives. Many afternoons you will be able to see a Mask Dance performance, a real treat. Get out of the big cities of South Korea and visit the authentic and very special Hahoe Folk Village."
