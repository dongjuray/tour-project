"masterpiece The Bulgaksa temple, was founded in 528 AD, and then rebuilt in 774 AD, is a Buddhist temple complex, very important and valuable for Koreans, was proclaimed by UNESCO, ""World Heritage Site"".The complex is beautiful, absolutely worth a view, you will be enchanted in front of these spectacular buildings, among the most beautiful in this nation."
"Beautiful temple complex A beautiful Buddhist temple where it is occasionally a climb. Beautiful wooded area. Busy, but intense enjoyment of the pilgrims and the beautiful buildings and colors."
"Great Temple Complex It is the temple of the Jogye Order within Korean Buddhism and contains six national treasures, including the Dabotap and Seokgatap stone pagodas, Cheongun-gyo (Blue Sky Bridge) and two golden bronze Buddha statues.  Large temple complex, absolutely attractive."
Not as impressive as anticipated but worth visiting if you have time.
"Said to be Korea's most important Buddhist museum, but I found it rather underwhelming and somewhat disappointing. A fair amount of English signage, but not enough context to gain a fuller understanding. Grounds are quite large considering there is not that much to see. It also takes almost an hour to get there by bus. A 90-minute visit should be sufficient. Free admission."
"Buddhist temple The largest temple in the city, accessible by bus from the city center.Allow on average one hour of visit. They are monuments with outdoor garden. No indoor visits."
"Beautiful temples Located on a mountainside, surrounded by flowering trees, this beautiful temple complex is of extraordinary beauty. It's very crowded, but it's big enough to travel it without burdens Beautiful place Beautiful place and interesting to visit. All temples had active services during our visit. Temples is in a scenic location."
Interesting!
"Located about 15 kilometres from Gyeongju, this Buddhist temple is in fact made up like all the others of a complex of several buildings. The largest is marked by two double staircases which are not grand but are very original.The whole appears a little sloppy but is very alive without being flashy. We note the multitude of prayer intentions hanging from the ceiling, the many flowery soups and colorful paper lanterns marking the birthday of Buddha."
Beautiful temple complex My husband and I spent a happy couple of hours wandering around the wooden shrines and stone pagodas in this beautiful and atmospheric temple complex.
"large temple with a Dabotap inside a Korean coin C ( 24.11.28 )It is a large temple that many of the middle-aged Koreans went on school trips when they were young, and it is well-decorated from the entrance to the temple. It is a tourist area in front of the temple with restaurants and accommodations, and it is a temple that holds a ten-won dabotap tower. It is not quiet because many people visit, but when you walk around, you can see beautiful architecture. It is a representative tourist destination in Gyeongju and a place that many people visit."
Fantastic and well maintained history.
Fascinating Silla dynasty history with well run burial mounds and museums. Great variety of historical guided tours.
"Visit requires a lot of travel time, difficult to get away from Nice temple but if you have little time to spend, definitely skip. Little information in English. Nowhere can find where the buses go back to Gyeongju. The journey from the centre takes 40 minutes by bus. We could not book an English Tour to get more explanation so that we were tired of it after three quarters of an hour. In the place itself there is so much beauty to see, such as the museum where you could spend the time in Gyeongju."
He deserves to see it.
From Gyeongju you can reach Bulguksa temple by bus in one hour and 20 minutes. It's a really interesting Buddhist temple complex to visit and devout Koreans come here to pray. Free admission. You can take pictures. For those who want then it is recommended to visit the Seokguram cave which is 20 minutes by bus from the temple.
"Buddhist complex the Bulguksa is a spectacular Buddhist temple complex very important for the local population.is one of the main historical sites in the country.in 1995 was included in the list of UNESCO World Heritage Sitestogether with the Seokguram Underground Temple, which is located 4 kilometers east of the main complex,considered a masterpiece of art from the reign of Silla."
Let's go early in the morning.
"I took KTX from Busan station. It takes about 30 minutes by KTX from Busan Station to Singyeongju Station. From Singyeongju station, we took the city bus and changed buses once to Bulgugsa bus stop, which took over an hour. From the Bulguksa bus stop, walk uphill for about 10 minutes to reach the Bulguksa Gate.I think it's good for a short trip to Busan."
"Outstanding old temple complex with a great history Bulgugsa Temple, GyeongjuOur first day trip away from Busan, led us to Gyeongju, In Gyeongju, you can appreciate not only the cultural heritage representing Buddhist culture but also the culture of the Korean old dynasties. Also, numerous relics have been excavated from Gyeongju and a lot of relics are still preserved at these historic sites, Gyeongju is a time-honored historic city in Korea and is one of the must-visit cities in Korea. It was the ancient capital of the Silla Dynasty for almost 1,000 years and the epitome of Korean history, culture, and tradition. Besides, the whole big city is on the UNESCO world heritage list!We ventured into the Bulgugsa Temple, About 90 minutes drive by car from Busan downtown (BIFF Place area) one thing for sure, we have never seen this many speed controlled area in the world,The temple was for sure worth a visit, and is extremely popular not only with Koreans, but also with Chinese and foreigners!Bulguksa Temple was built in 528, had been under reconstruction in 751-774, and was finally rebuilt in 774. It is well known for the beauty of the wooden temple itself and the artistic touch of the stone relics. Also, a large number of National treasures such as Dabotap Pagoda, Seokgatap Pagoda, Baegun-gyo Bridges, and the Golden Seated Amita Figure are left in the precincts of the temple.Some text was taken of a traveler’s website, as I couldn’t explain it any better!Credit goes to Trazy Blog, a site which I found most informative and worth using as a guidance!Enjoy the journey & the photos#busan #southkorea#touristystuff #gyeongju #bulgugsatemple #history#sightseeing Beautiful Buddhist complex Very nice, extensive temple complex where there is much to see and discover. ""Unfortunately"" she is felt by all tourists on the to-do list, so there is always a lot going on. Better visit in the morning.The facility is definitely worth a visit."
Toilet is far away.
I don't have too much shade to take pictures. I don't get a good picture.And the toilet is a little away from the fireplace.And there's no vacation.
Memorable temple Beautiful temple which we very much enjoyed. See attached picture as for more impressions. Make sure to see all surrounding buildings.
"World Heritage Temple on a Scale The day I visited was just a weekend and the weather was clear. There were a lot of cars trying to get into the parking lot. First, get out of the car and walk to Tenno-mon Gate, a World Heritage Site and six National Treasures. Inside the gate are large wooden statues of the Four Heavenly Kings with wide eyes. It is interesting to see the painted wooden figures holding swords and dragons and playing biwa-like instruments. The area around the main hall is so crowded with tourists and worshippers that it is hard to move. The four bridges connecting the secular world to the French land are so large that it is hard to get a complete picture. It is a large-scale temple that makes sense to be selected as a World Heritage Site."
This temple is dedicated to the Buddhist culture of the Silla period.
"It is a Silla period Buddhist temple registered as a World Heritage Site.Located on a small hill, it consists of a splendid temple, a dharma hall, and a sariras tower.It is interesting to see the unique style of Korean temple which is different from Japanese temple.I made a one-day visit from Seoul, and the high-speed train (KTX) arrives at Singyeongju Station, which is well outside the city center. From here, I take a 30-minute bus ride to the bus terminal in the city center (the bus to Bulguksa, which also connects from Singyeongju Station, does not enter the bus terminal, but uses the bus stop on the main street a little further away), and then take the No. 10 or 11 bus. It will take another hour or so from here, so it will take about an hour and a half in total.Personal travel is quite inefficient.I definitely recommend taking a tour to or from Seoul or Busan."
Bulguksa Temple Very peaceful surroundings- I enjoyed the architecture of the temple and of course it’s history.I would definitely recommend visiting this site- it give great insight into the history of Gyeongju.
Beautiful temple The Bulguksa temple is beautiful.The temples are all different from each other and it is always a new discovery to make when visiting one.It's pleasant and calming.I recommend.
"Mini Guide to Bulguksa Temple + Seokguram Grotto Bulguksa Temple is undoubtedly the most important sight in Gyeongju, so you MUST visit it.From downtown Gyeongju, buses 10, 11, 700, and 711 go to Bulguksa. You can pay for the ride with cash on the bus. Take the same buses back to the city.We visited on a Monday and didn’t have to pay an entrance fee.The large temple complex consists of many beautiful buildings on multiple levels, many containing larger or smaller versions of Buddha in solid gold.However, the most beautiful Buddha is up in Seokguram Grotto, 2.2 km from Bulguksa Temple. You can take a shuttle bus there, but if you’re up for a hike, you can walk.The trail starts at Bulguksa Maingate and is relatively steep all the way up. Technically, the path is easy enough; it’s shaded, well-maintained, and nice. But it requires good fitness and a bottle of water. The hike up to the grotto (which is basically a kind of shed) takes about 1 hour; the way down is much faster.As mentioned, the stone Buddha up there is stunning. It’s enclosed behind glass and cannot be photographed. But no worries, it’s considered one of South Korea’s most important religious works of immense artistic value, so even without a photo, you should enjoy the view for the 5 minutes it takes.You can also buy ice cream, food, drinks, and souvenirs at the temple area, and there are plenty of free toilets, so you don’t need to prepare much for the trip."
"Holders of the Tripitaka Koreana This temple complex is the principal temple of the Jogye Order of Korean Buddhism. This ancient temple complex has been around since the 6th century and contains some of the greatest national assets as decreed by the South Korean government. There are 5 main temples that were prominently listed on the map. The most important of these is the Daeungjeon Hall, which houses the Shakyamuni Buddha. This building also has the most elaborate and decorative dougongs out of all the temples. In truth, most of the temples including the unlisted subsidiary temple Nahanjeon are very pretty and all house beautiful bronze gilded statues of various buddhas. The most magnificent is probably the statue of Buddha in Museoljeon Hall, which houses a magnificent Buddha statue donated by the Thai Royal Family. There was free entry on the day of the visit thanks to a national holiday. To see so many amazing things for free just made the whole experience even greater."
"an impressive Buddhist temple This place is some way out of town. But well worth the effort. So I was able to see Bulguksa Temple through movv's Private Day Tour.For 10 hours, I comfortably watched Bulguksa Temple, as well as downtown Gyeongju and Seokguram Rock by car."
"Magnificent temple Wonderful temple to absolutely see. The setting, the atmosphere, even with a lot of people it remains exceptional, a must in the area."
"Superb set It is a whole complex with the temple, pagodas and other monuments. The current temple dates from the 8th century and was built during the height of the Silla kingdom. Unesco Cultural Heritage Site, the visit is very pleasant, even if you sometimes have to negotiate relatively high steps."
"Great Temple A nice big temple, we especially liked the lucky pig! However, it is also very overcrowded with tourists, which is why we liked the Seokbulsa Stone Temple in Busan better."
"Bulguksa Temple is an important and popular temple in Gyeongju We were holidaying in Busan and we decided to travel out for some sightseeing, which lead us to Gyeongju. Bulguksa Temple is an important and popular temple in Gyeongju. There are quite a few halls and you can see colourful lanterns at various parts of the temple. These lanterns can be rented to make wishes. Rental of lotus lanterns used to be KRW1,000,000, but now cost less.  There are also many structures on the grounds that are considered national treasures (stupa that was taken away during the Japanese occupation but was returned, the stone pagoda called Dabotap, etc).  There are stories behind various structures and halls, and reading them or joining a guided tour might give better insights.As we visited in a cold December 2023 where temperatures dipped to minus 6 degrees Celcius, the ponds and mini-waterfall were all frozen."
"Bulguksa Temple which is the best travel destination I recently traveled to Gyeongju on a solo trip.It was my first time visiting Gyeongju as an adult, and I enjoyed traveling from a different perspective than when I was younger.Having studied Korean history, I was able to feel the emotion and beauty of Korea, at Bulguksa Temple.What’s more, I understand why the Buddhist statues and pagodas inside the Temple are a World Heritage Site.So I recommend Bulguksa Temple which is the best travel destination to Foreign tourists.I hope you're able to enjoy the memories I had.You'll never regret it.Welcome to visit Bulguksa Temple in Gyeongju!"
"One of the most visited temples in the country A masterpiece of Korean Buddhist architecture and a UNESCO World Heritage Site, Bulguk-sa is a testament to the skill of local craftsmen and the religious fervor of the Silla period. Founded in 535, its current appearance dates back to the 8th century, and the partial reconstruction carried out in the 1970s is a real success. Built in accordance with the Lotus Sutra, it was intended to recreate the Buddhist ideal on earth, an eternal palace for the Buddha."
"A place with beautiful fall scenery in Gyeongju Bulguksa Temple in autumn boasts the most beautiful scenery in Gyeongju. Bulguksa Temple is covered in red autumn leaves, creating a beautiful scenery. If you want to enjoy the scenery of changing leaves, visit Bulguksa Temple in the fall. From 2023, admission will be free."
"Very pretty temple A very pretty temple to visit, I don't know much about history but I like the charm and approachA religion other than mine enriches me. I also liked all these flowering plants and the enormous bell with a pretty turtle on its base. No entry fee. Small museum in the enclosure. Interesting to visit for a fee.2000 WRONG The temple and the grotto, not to be missed An important place for Koreans, an evocative place, where history and religion meet. We visited it on a day of uncertain and cloudy weather and it still fascinated us."
Beautiful temple complex Large temple complex that was free when we visited. The complex is easily accessible by public transport (e.g. bus 11). The parking lots were very crowded.
Superb temple Nice day trip from Seoul just to see this little gem. Unique site not too crowded. Easy access. Hidden in the forest so perfect weather too.
Bulguksa Temple in Gangnam It was quite a discovery as we did not know much about it and just stumbled upon it getting out of t)he station as well as followed the signs. The Buddha statue was uniquely perched in the forest with the city building across from it🙏felt calm and at peace after praying to the Buddha 😄 Feel the dignity of Bulguksa Temple!
"if you want to experience a Korean history and traditional culture, i'd suggest visiting Bulguksa Temple! There are so many historical cultural properties. But you don't know much about Korean history? It's okay! There's also a free commentary and explanation service! You can listen to the details of Bulguksa Temple's birth, legend, and architecture for free! And there were specific explanation which was good education for children. So it's so nice to come with a family. And since Bulguksa Temple is large, a map is essential to check your location! The downside is that admission fees are more expensive than other places."
"A transquil and holy temple We arrived at sunset time with less crowd and gentle sunshine. The golden sunlights covered the garden, temple and whole place as a holy land. We are touched and inspired while walking around the area."
Very impressive temple. Well worth visiting Impressive set in lovely Park with a lane. Multiple temples with historic treasures dating back to 7th century buddish.
"Very impressive complex Very old and very large complex.This place is huge and has just enough signage to make sense of it, but better with a guide Must-visit UNESCO World Heritage Site in Gyeongju Woke up early to get to Bulguksa via Bus 10/11, which took around 1 hour to get there. Be prepared for a steep climb up to reach the temple entrance. Fees were 6,000 won per person, which allowed you to roam the temple vicinity but was worth it. Able to explore all the buildings within the temple compound, but had to pay additional 2,000 won to visit the Bulguksa Museum, which we skipped. The temple compound was amazing and really cannot be missed when being in Gyeongju. Must go!"
"Bulguksa Temple Bulguksa  Temple is  a head temple of the Joyge Order of Korean Buddhism and is a UNESCO World Heritage Site.  It is a UNESCO World Heritage Site . It   located on the slopes of Mount Toham Jinheon-dong, Gyeongiu city 1000 years of age One of the oldest temple in South Korea (not only in Gyeongju) you must go there when you arrive to Gyeongju. That's one the best heritage of South Korea Bulguksa Temple in Gyeongju The travel destination I recommend is Gyeongju, a city of cultural heritage. If you are interested in the Unified Silla Period, one of the history of Korea, you can visit Bulguksa Temple, Seokguram Hermitage, Gyeongju National Museum, and Gyeongju Historic Site to experience the culture and life of that period. If you are only staying Gyeongju for a little while, you should probably go to Bulguksa Temple, which is a representative place that represents Buddhist culture during the Unified Silla Period. Bulguksa Temple has a Three-story Stone Pagoda and Dabotap Pagoda, and if you don't take pictures here, you can't say you visited Bulguksa Temple. Cherry blossoms are in full bloom in spring and autumn leaves can be seen in fall, so it is a good place to take pictures."
"Ancient yet timeless symbols Bulguksa “Buddha World” is nearly 1400 years old but dates back originally to the Goryeo dynasty (918-1392). The Lotus Sutra pagoda dates to the 8th c. and all can be seen in 1 hour. Sakyamuni “Buddha of the present” and bodhisattvas of Mt Jiuhua (Anhui) and the number 63 were venerated in the halls to the rear, where Korean treasures were stolen by Japan—including 3 stone lion guards and 2 buddhas (never returned since 1905). The two fingers represent Buddha’s world: foolishness and wisdom are the same. Bulguksa is an ancient temple that shows shamanistic influences—as seen in the colours also adopted in palaces—rivalling Baekje/ South-Central Jeolla province’s spiritual capital of Jeonju city, revered in the later Joseon dynasty. Here at Bulguksa, one sees the ancient Indian inspired Buddhist markings. (Seoul’s will appear less Indian.) The Lotus Gate to the supreme golden Amitabha Buddha of western Paradise is a symbol of being reborn. Outside the 1750 courtyard building in front, the golden pig has its significance as a good luck symbol, also worn as a pendant in religiously conservative towns like Andong. Each hanging paper from the flanking lotus lanterns in side passages costs 10,500 KRW, for those who paid to leave a prayer or wish. A public washroom is near the parking lot, and climbing or steep descent about one level is required to exit rear halls. Anyone scared of heights may choose to only view the main hall and stone pagodas. From Busan, it’s a wonderful trip and simpler to go instead to 14th century Yonggungsa Temple (taking the light rail from Haeundae-Mipo, near the shores of Hilton Ananti), thankfully, not bombed by Chinese during the Korean War."
Superb temple This is some way out of town but well worth the effort. This is an atmospheric temple in rural location.  One of the best “sights” in the area.
"A must-see in Korea That I’m a temples enthusiast is out of any doubt, if you follow me and read my reviews, and this one makes no exception. It definitely captures your heart, it makes you feel part of this world and culture. If you’re lucky, you can also find some local festivities!"
"Unforgettable This was truly an amazing experience. My only issue with this, and all the other temples, was that it was difficult for me to put Korean buddhism in context. I wish tours were more readily available or at least English-speaking attendants so I could inquire as to the importance or meaning of so many of the amazing things I saw Nice surprise It was great to visit, very quiet, clean and beautiful. Get there on the week-end when it open around 8~8:30, after 9:30~10 it become too crowded to enjoy."
Great piece of history We visited this site to get a little more experience on the cultural front and it was really good. Very reasonable prices and well laid out with signage in various languages including English.
"Beautiful scenes and making memories with wish rock stacking Once you get to the Bulgaksa Temple be prepared to be awed by the ancient architecture. It is very well preserved and the beauty of the buildings are very nice to observe. The walk is a long stretch so be prepared to walk a length, but I say it is worth it to see this historic place in person. There is even a little spot where people stack rocks on top of each other and make a wish. It was a very nice memory with a group of friends."
MOST AMAZING PLACE TO GO WITH YOUR FAMILY!!!!
"Beautiful temple,cool environment and serene .amazing for getting away from the bustling of the city and its environment can also be used for a picnic has its own market nearby where you can get all you need.very colorful and its buildings are beautiful and unique.its one of the top sites to see in gyeongju. its accessible by car and bus and also close to other tourist sites in gyeongju its  a must see.Very easy to locate and buses run through the route on the hours so you dont have to fear.While coming make sure you dont miss your camera there are lost of things to see and lots of pictures to take and come early too you can only go into the temple from 9am to 4pm but you can enjoy the serene environment to your heart content."
"Amazing Beautiful temple with an interesting historical background. I really recommend taking part in a guided tour to get all the information. The information center with the tour hours is near the middle pond. Our guide was excellent, lovely, and very patient in answering our questions! It was an extraordinary experience. Absolutely great sight. One of the best temples I've gone to South Korea. Most of the sights are restored building from a bit after the Japanese occupation, around 1973. There are a few stone monuments that are original, however. There is also plenty of information about each statue and building talking about the significance of each. Definitely check out if you're in Gyeongju!"
A UNESCO HERITAGE SITE This is one of the top sites in Gyeongju. Loved the architecture as well as the many colourful lanterns hanging around the premises of this UNESCO site. The lanterns added charm to this temple and is great for photo taking. Worth visiting.
"The Most Famous Buddhist Temple in Korea It's a must-see place in Gyeongju.  When it comes to Gyeongju, Bulguksa Temple comes to mind. As it is a UNESCO World Heritage Site, it is beautiful and has many tourists. It is a reminder of the beauty and preciousness of Korean cultural heritage. The scenery inside Bulguksa Temple is also very beautiful. If I have a chance, I would like to visit here again.경주에서 꼭 봐야 할 곳이다. 경주 하면 불국사가 떠오른다. 유네스코 세계문화유산인 만큼 아름답고 관광객이 많다. 한국 문화유산의 아름다움과 소중함을 일깨워주는 장소이다. 불국사 내부의 풍경도 매우 아름답다. 기회가 된다면 이곳을 다시 방문하고 싶다."
Wonderful Silla Temple!
"This is a beautiful temple built in 560. It is an example of Silla architecture. it is UNESCO site. The temple is very well preserved. It is a Buddhist temple. It has three areas dedicated to Buddha, Happiness, and Illumination. The temple is large. It is very easy to visit. You have to pay entrance ticket. Staff is very kind. The place is very photogenic.We stayed in Gyeongju. Wee visited the temple during the second day of our visit to this region. Bulguksa is very easy to reach from Gyeongju. You can take a comfortable bus. It takes 40 minutes to get to Bulguksa. After this, we went to the Grotto by bus. We came back to Bulguksa and took the bus back to Gyeongju. We visited on September. the weather was perfect and the colors were phenomenal due to the Fall.You need at least three hours to visit the temple. It can get crowded by locals; however, the crowd is not overwhelming. Koreans behave very well, they are very courteous! they history is fantastic!"
"Worth a visit Historic temple in Gyeongju worth a visit. Especially to the 3 stone gates. This temple is fairly large, do cater a bit more time when visiting. Can be crowded. Despite the crowd, the temple still feels tranquil. Best to visit in autumn as the foliage is amazing."
Great walk and history Started by driving up to the historic Buddha shine above Bulguska. After visiting there we waliked the trail (2.2km) down to the temple area. We stopped for a picnic about 2/3 of the way down. A great place to visit if you’re interested in Korean history or want to bring those Korean TV shows to life. The walk up was mildly difficult being uphill all the way. But it took less than one hour. Well worth the visit.
"In a lovely location Worth a visit to see a lovely temple in lovely surroundings. In a nice spot, if you like hking-there are trails to choose from!"
"Beautiful temple, yet too crowded This is a must do attraction when in this town, as it’s a UNESCO world heritage site. Beautiful surroundings, a bit pricey though."
Historic It's a historic place so expected to have many tourist. But still peacefull a lovely enviroment. Having a nice walk around the park.
One of the Most Popular Attractions in Gyeongju!
"If there is one place that you should visit, it is Bulguksa. This UNESCO World Heritage Site is an amazing temple that offers a lot of history and insight into not only Buddhist culture but Korean history as well.The grounds are beautiful year round but the best times to visit have to be around spring when the cherry blossoms are blooming and fall when the leaves are falling. Keep in mind that these are also peak times as well. Granted it is always busy there.If you are visiting around Buddha's Birthday in the beginning of May, that is another great time to visit. The temple will be open late and there will be special performances throughout the evening."
"Fantastic! Majestic! Breath-Taking The most picturesque place I had been to during a short trip to Busan.  Every corner of my eyes there bound to be something nice & eye-catching...structures of the temple, the intricacies of the structures, the trees, the dated stairs, the pathway, the small lake, the wishing lanterns & streamers, the wishing stones & pebbles, the foliage, all had the unexplainable beauty and colours.  History didn’t fade them away, very well preserved.It’s a beautiful heritage worth a visit, very well kept & very clean indeed.  As the weather was cool, strolling around the entire temple property as well as its vicinity was such a joy and pleasant experience.  Unfortunately, I couldn’t upload more pictures, you will have to discover the beauty yourself."
"A beautiful and wonderful temple My husband and I visited Bulguksa in December and found it just beautiful.  Even though there were a lot of people around, you still got a sense of peace.  Street vendors on the way up to the temple.  We loved it.  we visit here after our trip down from Seokguram.  Very easy to get here in a public bus.  Go to the information centre next to the bus terminal, opposite Starbucks and they will give you the up to date information.  So glad we visited."
"Relaxing, and fresh air Too many Chinese package tourists, so unfortunately the serene and calm site couldn’t be enjoyed to its full potential, but it was a nice and historic place. A good walk through the entire thing. Very steep stairs but it was enjoyable."
"A key highlight of Gyeongju We took the one day heritage tour with Trazy. Super affordable and brings you to all the key heritage areas, including the Bulguksa Temple. The tour is conducted in Korean but it doesn't matter to us as we only need the transport to bring us around the key sites.The temple was really lovely. Very nice view. Definitely worth a visit."
A bit different.
This is a more interesting temple. slightly different in design and with ponds and bridges make it a lovely place to stroll around.
Meditative Martial Art The master was very impressive with extremely slow incredible movements. Beginners were similar to other Korean martial arts with typical moves and speed.  The hike up the steps to the demonstration and on up to a viewpoint from the temple could be daunting to some visitors.
Oldest temples from the Shilla dynasty!
Bulguksa temple is one of the UNESCO world heritage sites in the world. It has seen a lot of wars-destroyed and built again. The stone pagodas are still maintained and are an insight of how life has been in the ancient years.The temple itself encompasses the Korean Buddhist art from the Shilla dynasty. It is easily accessible by public transport as it's one of the major tourist attractions of Gyeongju.
"Beautiful grounds and temple We enjoyed an afternoon walk around the temple grounds. The trees were still in bloom the end of November and were so vibrant and pretty! Fees are 5,000w/ adult and 2,500w/child. Pretty bridges with waterfalls made for stunning photos. We spent less than an hour here so made for a nice outing."
"Massively beautiful A very expansive property including both Gardens and enormous Temples, Statues, and Prayer notes.  Actually more things to comprehend than a several hour visit allows.Very colorful.  But you need to look up and also closely at all the details."
Gyeongju UNESCO World Heritage Temple We take bus no 11 from town to Bulguksa Temple. we enjoyed the slow scenic walk up the temple. Nice and peaceful place to visit Active temple with praying monks We spent a couple of hours here wandering in and out of the various temples and paid the extra 2000 won to go into the new museum within the temple complex. The museum was quite good and all the explanations were also in English. There was a tea shop too (quite expensive by local standards) which we didn’t try but the menu looked quite good. It was fairly busy on a Tuesday in November.....I can imagine it might get very busy in high season.
"scenic walk up We took the city tour bus which also include the Seokguram Grotto, two tombs and a shrine.  we enjoyed the slow scenic walk up the temple.  Beautiful autumn trees lined the place and the weather was great.  Nice and peaceful place to visit So colourful I enjoyed the walk up from the bus station. My favourite part was the colourful lanterns, all the colours of the rainbows Very scenic in autumn Like most Korean temples and palaces, this is a total rebuild. It is in use for worship and has a certain atmosphere about it, enhanced by lovely gardens. An easy bus ride from Gyeongju."
Wow and a sunny day We took an earlyish bus from town in the morning so when we arrived there were very few people there. Great location and interesting temple to visit. On a sunny day its beautiful.
"One of the most beautiful temple in S. Korea This wide complex of temples is amazing. It is located in the gyeongju national park. Besides being a beautiful temple, the nature around is luxurious."
"Magnificent Structure and Gardens With a number of specific Buddha temples we were privileged to hear monks chanting prayers in each one. The hypnotic rhythms echoed beyond the temple walls. The grounds are beautiful with gateways framing views of stately trees. Also there is a beautiful large pond. The buildings, themselves also have a majestic presence."
Truly worth the visit.
Lovely grounds - lots of children on field trips but that just reinforces what a great spot this is.
Massive Temple Complex This is a sizable temple complex with numerous temples. There is some walking and a fair amount of steps involved. The place can be peaceful when not too crowded. It was great to learn some history and see some interesting temples.
"Gyeongju trip is worth it One hour bus drive from Busan Sasang bus terminal, then 50 minutes bus 10 or 11 to Bulguksa temple - 15 minutes walk to the temple. We needed 2 hours. A very old temple complex in the forests. Amazing."
Beautiful temple This beautiful temple is out of the main Gyeongju city. The main temple is surrounded by smaller buildings that can be accessed too & surrounded by gardens. Well worth a visit for the buildings architecture.
"Beautiful temple So huge, so beautiful, the temple, the statues, the park.. Everything was wonderful for people who like historic visit. Prefer visit early un the morning and so you can visit after  the Gyeongju world parc who is a great amusement park not expendive and not far from the temple (same bus) Birthday trip Of the three temples I visited during trip this was my favorite. I could almost feel the uniqueness, and solemn atmosphere they are trying to maintain. This visit was really eye opening for me. The hour we spent here was too short. We experienced the Buddha’s prayer period and even saw one walking across the grounds. Soo much rich history here. The grounds are well preserved. Great place to visit. Wished we could spend at least a weekend here. So serene. Hopefully I posted the right pics."
"The Most Beautiful Temple In South Korea One of the best things I have seen in South Korea, with no doubt!Bulguksa Temple (UNESCO World Heritage) is located on a mountain, not far from Gyeongju.There's a main temple and other pagodas and shrines.Colours,stunning architecture and history are only few of many other things you can find in this magnificent site!"
"Sprawling Temple grounds As many sites in Gyeongju this temple is outside of town, but easily accessible by city bus. Set on a small incline the temple grounds have about 20 buildings with great views + architectural detail. When you exit, a cluster of restaurants starts across the street. Towards the right, a little 'Dog cafe', run by a young couple made the BEST COFFEE I had in Korea. (Not sure I find them here, so I let you know under the temple review)."
Huge temple ground A very big temple ground to explore. The surrounding park and lake is perfect for strolling and picture taking. The main temple ground is quite similar to most temple ground I have visited in China and elsewhere. Near by have lots of restaurants to try out delicious Korean food.
"Gorgeous temple One of the highlights of our visit to Gyeongju. This temple complex is quite big, so you'll need some time to discover every beautiful building. The surroundings are gorgeous and there is a huge car and bus park right next to the entry. Very convenient. If you're hungry: just cross the road, you'll find a lot of nice restaurants there."
"lovely temple Beautiful temple complex. Try to be early in the morning, as it can be quite busy with visitors. Lots of parking though."
"Easy to find We took a bus here and walking around the park was lovely. There were a few really interesting large statues and religious shrines. It wasn't too crowded. It's a great place to get your steps in :) Amazing Amazing and beautiful temple.  Each temple was well maintained, and a few had people praying and meditating.  Many folks made a point to bow and pay respects at each shrine.  There were 4 or 5 different Buddhas each in their own shrine/temple.  Each represented a different iteration of Buddha, and all were beautiful.  Be careful with your photos, as the temple requests no pictures inside the individual shrines, although outside shots are ok.  The walk from the parking lot isn't far, and is very nice.  Beautiful representation of temples.  A must see.  There's a reason it's one of the most famous temples in Korea and a UNESCO site.  Well worth going to."
Beautiful We took the number 11 bus to get here which seems to go quite regularly. It took about 35 minutes to get here and we got on the bus just across the road from Mc Donald's near enough to the Intercity bus terminal. You can also take the number 10 bus. The stop was announced in English. The site is beautiful and easy to wander around. The temple is big and in a lovely scenic location. We loved it. It was 5000won for entry which is about €4.
Amazing experience!
"I have never been to a Buddhist temple, and this was an experience of a life time! The grounds and temple are meticulously cared for and pictures cannot not do justice to showing the detail. It was an honor to tour the grounds and to see the Monks doing their prayers and recitals. Only tip is to give a heads up on being respectful and remaining silent in most areas (in other words, this is NOT a playground for unsupervised children)."
"Sense of peace The weather was really hot at about 31 degrees. However, when we arrived at the temple compound, it felt windy and peaceful. It’s nice to just walk around the compound and to various halls for praying. We easily spend slightly over 2 hours in the temple. You can take cab which costs about 18k won from bus terminal or bus no. 10 which cost about 1,700 won. As we were unsure of the route, we took a cab there and return by taking the bus."
Beautiful temple of world heritage site Very old temple and listed as world heritage.   A must to to if you visit Gyeongju.   The complex is grand and located at a very good location.   Easy to visit by bus.
"Phenomenal Temple The temple complex was another UNESCO world heritage site in Gyeongju and its setting, surrounded by forests in the mountains, gave this a very tranquil and beautiful setting for worshipping and visiting.The paths to all the sites were gravel and sand which made for an easy walk around the complex.  The pathways were nicely landscaped with trees, ponds, and bridges giving us many photo opportunities.One of the first gates we passed through contained a number of colorful and fierce deities.  A small museum on Bulguksa was located off the main path but we did not go in.   The Jahamun Gate was part of the main wall enclosing the front of the temple complex and the most popular spot for photos.  However, no one could actually enter through this gate and were directed off to the side entrances to gain entrance into the halls.  We were able to get close to many of the halls and peek inside but as we were not active worshippers we stayed outside.   Overall, lots of effort and attention to detail went into the reconstruction of many of these halls to replicate the original buildings lost during war.The most famous golden Sakyamuni Buddha was located in the Daeungjeon Hall.  There were a few other statues located in different halls but this was the most accessible.As we walked further back into the complex, we climbed a steep set of stairs to view the Gwangneumjeong Hall which was the highest building overlooking the rest of the temple.If anyone feels adventurous then an hour plus walk to the Seokguram Grotto was possible from the temple."
"Very special temple We would recommend visiting this Temple - it is one of the major tourist attractions, and deserved of its reputation."
"Stunning Beautiful, tranquil place and setting. Take your time and stroll slowley taking in all the colors of the lanterns.Multiple buildings and shrines to visit. Our kids enjoyed exploring the stairs and different areas. Free spring water to refill your bottles, small gift stores. Decent price as you can spend hours here exploring. Beautiful photos to be taken except inside the temples where people are praying."
"amazing temple complex this is one of the best and amazing temples around Gyeongju. You can't go inside some of the buildings but just to appreciate the history and architecture Authentic Palace As with all Asian palaces, they get kind of repetitive after the first few courtyards. The one thing that I thought was remarkable about this palace and made it stand out was the rock stacking courtyard. Make sure you find it and see it! It is a big garden full of hundreds of piles of nicely stacked rocks. People will stack rocks as a ""prayer"" that they hope will come true as their rocks stay high and balanced.This is a great place to visit if you're in Gyeongju area, but I wouldn't travel too far to visit this."
Rain Take express-bus line 700 from Singyeongju ktx-station ;stops in front of temple-complex.Beautiful complex in good condition.Opposite the complex are restaurants.
"Good view Nice old place. Korea authentic. Must go for foreign. Nice place for good photo too.   Luckily the weather is with ua that day. Nice Beautiful temple From the temples I visited in Korea, this was my favourite. It looks beautiful, and has a nice garden. It was crowded with tourists and also lots of children on school trips."
"Beautyful Nice place to visit. Very well kept, lot to see. Also nice walk in the park. We were there on “childrens day” so very busy."
"A historic worth place on Unified Silla left Aside Angkor Wat, this place is serenely catching my eyes with peaceful view. It is not a big place to roam around but the architectures, its carving and its artifacts are the treasures to view and to appreciate.  I strongly recommend visitors to visit this place if you plan to travel to Gyeongju and before you start to enter the temple, do visit the Bulguksa Temple Musuem first for the treasures and some background introductions before proceeding the temple for viewing, especially the pagodas.I personally felt that the visit in autumn season would be best, as it shows the most beauty sight of the temple and its surroundings. I would definitely come again to have the autumn sight."
"Bulguksa temple + Seokguram Grotto + Golgulsa Temple Pretty avarage temple as many others in korea, pretty big (entrance fee about 5 dollars, free at budha's birthday), but if you are already at that temple, absolutely recommend walking to Seokguram Grotto (about 50 minutes walk a bit of uphill and another entrance fee 5 dollars). There is only a big stone statue in artificial cave behind the class, but it is amazing. Totally different as other temples in korea, and you can ask for english guide that will tell you a lot interesting stuff about it. And another temple nearby is Golgulsa Temple (this temple is for free) specializing in martial arts and there you can see martial arts performance every day at 15:00 (expect on mondays) UNESCO site and worth seeing at least once I’m not a Buddhist but reading about the history and when it was built was really amazing. I went there with my Buddhist friend and she went inside the halls to pray. I stayed outside to look around and appreciate the architecture and history."
"A walk back in time Extremely popular, especially for school groups. Don't let that deter you. What you get to visit is but a small part of the complex. The restoration has been superb. The new indoor museum, great on a cold day, has wonderful pieces from the history of the ancient complex, worth the small entry fee."
"Nice walk to the history We enjoyed this walk around very much. We felt it is a sacred place. It was a really nice journey to the past. We were also surprised by the number of visitors. Take your time to enjoy it, as there are not too many similar places in Korea."
"Buddah beath One of the oldest temple in Korea. If you will read the story and  the timing of build- you can't compare it to anything in Europe. So noce and colourful.of course so many tourists are walking there, but after the season of the vacation is not bad. Good place to take a spring photos and slow down for a moment."
"Centuries of history and culture Bulguksa Temple is on the western slope of Mt Tohamsan and what you see today is only a small part of the entire site. The Temple has been restored but the site was originally much much bigger, but what is there today is certainly impressive. Well worth its title of a World Heritage Site that represents the amazing skills of the Silla architects and how important the Buddhist faith was then. The pagodas, bridges and gardens and simple beautiful. Well worth a visit but there are a lot of steps and some can be a little steep."
Beautiful Spent a few hours here in this well maintained Temple and it's surroundings.  Should be incorporated with visiting Seokguram.
"Interesting temple as part of an excursion We took a taxi to the Seokguram grotto, then walked the path downhill to the Bulguksa Temple.  The path is extremely well constructed and easy to find, but in the steeper downhill section at the beginning, there's some loose gravel that can be slippery, so be cautious. The trail flattens out in the second half as you get closer to Bulguksa.  There's a new visitors center in Bulguksa, which provides a nice overview.  We did not have a guide, and so in hindsight, I think we missed a lot of interpretation about why this temple matters.  But overall, it was a lovely and interesting excursion."
"love that place I really like that place, about ancient history.. the guide is the best and very friendly. i really liked that place and reccomend to anyone Need to walk  bit to get there Nice easy walk  to the Bulguksa temple. it was bit cold when I got there, but it was totally worth the effort.  Luckily when I went there it wasnt too crowded..."
"Nice temple in beautiful location I came here on an all-day bus tour from the information centre at the Gyeongju bus station. I have seen Buddhist temples in many countries, but was a bit disappointed with this one considering that it’s a UNESCO World Heritage site and is rated the best in Korea."
"Historical Buddhist temple If you combine with Cherry blossom in early April it will be a beautiful tour around Gyeongju. If you are interested in Buddhist temples in Korea, this will be one of must see. Entrance costs 5000 Korean Won."
"Very nice Beautiful temple.  The area surrounding it is also beautiful. We went on a sunny day and really enjoyed our visit. Cost wise, it is a bit pricey, but still interesting."
Stunning architecture „World of Buddha Temple“ with extraordinary Silla architecture particularly the paintings on the roofs were breathtaking.
"You can miss it If this was the only reason I came here from Busan, it would be a wasted trip. It's a pleasant temple with rich history, but so are hundreds of other temples in South Korea.If you are coming from Busan, you can take an express train to Singyeongju Station and then the 700 bus that will bring you directly to the temple. The bus also passes the Bird Park, so you may want to drop in there."
Wonderful to visit but...
"It's definitely worth a visit. A very large and expansive temple complex; comparable to Gyeongbukgong in Seoul. Gyeongju is the place to visit for history of the Silla dynasty. On the downside, it gets very crowded, there are lots of restrictions on photography and its 5000 won to get in plus an extra 5000 for the Seokguram grotto. Definitely a cash cow."
"A great place to visit in Gyeongju Religious sacred place is always in my list of places to visit. There’s different buddha statue that explain their different purpose. I love the bright colours of the hanging paper lanterns. There’s also an area where you could build mini pagoda using stones, which i find it cute. I built mine, and you can get creative and have fun building yours too!"
"Historical Me & my friends enjoyed here. The venue is pretty spacious, ancient and beautiful. They keep the place well maintained for an old temple."
Superb!
"We arrived at the Bulguksa Temple complex after a half-hour drive from Gyeongju. It was late in the afternoon on a foggy day with a heavy rain, which probably contributed to a quiet and enjoyable visit. The temple complex is exceptional in its significance for the Korean Buddhism and its artistry. The location and the surroundings are simply magnificent! We started by visiting the museum at the entrance, then spent about 3 hours slowly walking around and admiring all the beautiful architecture, decorations, statues, and the landscape. We had a wonderful guide, very knowledgeable and patients, eager to answer our questions. If you have time, try to discover the playful ceiling wooden sculptures spread across the temple buildings - the Good-luck Pig being probably the most famous of them! The short hike to the Seokguram Grotto was invigorating and totally worth the effort! The Buddha sculpture in the Grotto is incredibly beautiful in its serenity and the whole architectural complex inside the Grotto incredibly beautiful! Definitely recommended, a must-see UNESCO World Heritage place!"
Ancient and magnificent Lovely attraction. The autumn leaves were at peak and plenty of photo opportunities for fall sceneries.The gardens were well kept and the array of stones stacked in balanced was awesome.Enjoyed the walk at this well conserved site.
"Try to come at a quiet time I was really excited to see this place, as I have seen tons of beautiful temples and have heard great things about this one. However, coming around 11am on a Sunday morning made this should-be peaceful place a nightmare. It was completely packed with pushy people and running and screaming unsupervised children. The buildings as part of this temple seem quite lovely but we got very little time to take them in and enjoy them because we were constantly dodging children or old mannerless people. The museum had some good information, but again we were aggressively shoved by two old men on two separate occasions so we couldn't wait to get out. The souvenir shops are also full of overpriced items that I know from experience I can get for cheaper in Seoul. You can also see other old, beautiful temples throughout Korea with significantly less people, such as in Busan and Eumseong. It was a real shame as this seems like it should be a good place worth the 5 dollar per person ticket, but it ended up being one of the worst tourist destinations we have had the experience with - and we've traveled a lot. Huge disappointment. Try to plan to come at a quieter time."
"Beautiful temple to visit Another Silla era treasure.  Pagodas, a lake, bridges, beautiful gardens. A very wealthy temple and the largest in South Korea. Well worth a visit but the souvenir shop didn’t impress. Loved the colourful lanterns though Nice temple visit The visit to Bulguksa temple was worthy despite it's entrance fee of 5,000 won being higher than most places in Korea. You can visit several pavilions and see the beautiful wood carvings. There are also 2 korean-style stone pagodas.It's recommend to do this visit together with Seokguram grotto as it is only a 2.2km hike away (uphill if starting from Bulguksa) or connected by Bus 12. Getting to Bulguksa from central Gyeongju was quite fast with Buses 10 or 11."
"A must see Due to jet lag we arrived there only around 11 a.m. and very afraid that it was crowded.However,despite several busses of visitors rather quiet and civilzed.Wonderful experience,well worth the 5 USD entrance fee.Highly recommended."
"Wonderful in Autumn We were lucky enough to visit Bulguksa in Autumn when the leaves were changing colours and it was just wonderful. One of the most beautiful places we went in Korea, just as lovely as the secret garden at Changdeokgung. I recommend visiting earlier in the day than we did - we got there at about 10:30 or 11am and it was already quiet crowded. I bet it would have been much quieter if we went before 9am! We caught the bus from the city centre and it took us longer than we thought to find the bus stop, wait for the bus and ride the bus to Bulguksa, so do leave plenty of time for that. I wish we had put the effort in to get up early!"
"Stunning autumn colours Visited the temple in early Nov. and it was really beautiful in autumn. A unique temple with two stone staircases at the front. There was a lake surrounded by colourful autumn trees. Although there were many tourists, the place was not crowded because of the large gardens and courtyards."
My second time to visit My family went to Gyeongju second time while visit we always visit Bulguksa Temple It's very famous temple in Korea. I like this place A nice morning walk !
"5000 per adults to enter. About 1h to 2h walk in a very calm and nice environment.Temple is really well maintained and is definitely worth looking at.Opens at 7am, which is convenient to avoid all the tour buses."
"Very popular and crowded UNESCO Heritage site One of the must visit UNESCO sites when in Gyeongju.  It was quite crowded when we went as there were lots of tourist groups and domestic student groups.  The temple is quite large with many stairs and buildings, so take your time to wander around.  Best to visit the temple in the early morning as this is the place that's furthest from town and not close to other attractions.  Take bus 10, 11 and 700."
Must visit place UNESCO Heritage site This temple is a must visit place if you are in Gyeongju. It is a UNESCO Heritage site. The temple is very old and has been rebuilt many times. The architecture and the natural beauty is really worth the visit.
Worth the visit Came here at 1725. 5min till their entrance close. The staff told me that theres no exit time limit. Im surprised. Its a really well maintained temple. A pray inside to wish for luck.
"A Uniquely Beautiful Amalgam of Architecture, Art, Culture and History More like an outdoor museum, the Bulguksa Temple offers a singularly beautiful display of architecture, art and history. It is well worth your time. Read on for details.Surrounded by beautiful landscape and, when we were there, trees changing colors, the landscape around the temple is serene and restful. Well the temple shears features with so many others in this country, the size, preservation and details set it apart. We have been to our share of temples throughout Southeast Asia and the Himalayas but the Bulguksa Temple stood out for its beauty and vastness Overnight Temple Stay at Bulguksa We stayed at Bulguksa overnight in August.  Our guide was Jodie she was fantastic, very knowledgeable and willing to help.  On arrival we were taken to the accommodation which was a very new Hanok, sleeping on the traditional mats, there were plenty of them, so was reasonably comfortable.  It had an ensuite bathroom and air conditioning.  The food was plain and simple but you could eat as much as you wanted - if you put it on your plate you must eat it.  Being in and around the Temple once the other tourists had gone was so peaceful.  We opted to make the Lotus flowers instead of the 108 prostrations.  The early morning ceremony with the monks was an incredible experience and the tea ceremony was brilliant the monk had a real sense of humour.  Overall a must do if you are in south, South Korea."
Very impressive experience (temple stay) Our temple stay was a very impressive experience! Our host did explain everything from the history of the temple to ceremonies held in it. Included in the stay is a very intense drum and mediation ceremony after sunset. Also you’ll sleep an a Hanok on thin mat on a heated floor. Very rudimentary but thats part of the experience! There is also a dinner and breakfast with the monks of the monastery. Do it!
Historical and spiritual place A visit to Gyeongju with its plentitude of historical places isn’t complete without a visit to this temple. Take a bus or drive your car and enjoy the sights and sounds of this charasteristic Buddhist temple.
"Great cultural experience Cheapest way to get there from Gyeongju is by bus, numbers,10,11 and 700 all do the job. On the number 10 its the stop after the Kolon hotel and golf course. But the stops are easily recognised, being written on the stop roof.Bus stops by tourist information centre, walk past this through the car park and up through the park towards the right and you will see the main entrance. Admission 5000 each.Temple is impressive and was busy on our visit. There are steps but its worth the effort.To eat here ( whilst we waited for the shuttle bus) come out of the temple back down the hill to the tourist information centre, there is a big complex on the other side of the road. We are at Rans Kitchen and had an excellent lunch. Its located on the far left , as you look from the tourist info. Centre."
"Colourful lantern Big temple and leisurely stroll inside would give you peaceful mind. It's so peaceful and quiet during my visit, no group no children. Also many colourful lantern around. Good for picturesque. I use bus 10 opposite train terminal, first bus stop near the bank. According to the KakaoMap, bus 10, 11 and 700 can be taken from this bus stop. If unsure can always check with information counter or at the bus stop. Bus stop will appear bus number with arrival time.You also can go Seokguram Grotto if you have extra time, if not just forget this temple. you can choose to hike up from the ticket counter or shuttle bus no.12. Hiking up take around 1 hour for 2km and from entrance of Seokguram another 1.4km, total walk 3.6km, as per sign. If you're hiking up, you'll be greet with lots of stairs, spring water, crazy view, insects, maple tree, mud path. While taking bus must be well aware of the timing as it run hourly and the journey takes 40mins at 1,700won per person. So choose wisely and plan well. Personal advise, better go up by bus and hike down. It's faster hiking down and up."
"Wonderful historic ensemble It is a must to see that temple - a masterpiece of buddhist art.UNESCO world heritage.Not far away the unique Seokguram cave from the 8th century Lots of steps Very Interesting temple.  There are lots of steps but the view is worth it.  The steps are also very steep.  Well worth the visit Not as gorgeous as those in Southeast Asia Although the temple is beautiful and well preserved, it is not comparable to the budhist complexes in southeast asia. Worth a quick visit."
"Huge temple, but not unlike other Asian Temples A huge-ish historical complex that is rebuilt after the Japanese burned it down. Very similar to other historical Buddhist Asian temples. Highly encourage you to visit this place if you have not experienced Asian temples before. The entire area is calming and serene.Am particularly amazed by a section in the temple where they stacked rocks on top of each other to resemble pagodas. It's like a mini city itself.You can take Bus 12 from the main road below the temple to go to Seokguram Grotto. Bus 12 departs every hourly when we were there. There are also numerous eateries at the main road leading up to the temple. You can get here via Bus 10, 11 and 700.A must visit in Gyeongju due to its UNESCO status. For the religious, you can also pray to the deities here. If you're interested, you can also sign up to spend the night in the temple for a small fee. There's a counter in front of the temple for you to ask or you can Google for more info regarding the temple stay."
Beautiful example of Silla Architecture Our visit was part of a cruise ship tour.  It's a beautiful temple perched on the slopes of Mt. Tohamsan.  It's a very restful serene place and well worth a visit.
This was an amazing experience!
This was an amazing experience! We were able to have tea with the high priest and ring the reunification bell.
"Large Temple Complex in Scenic Surroundings To get to the Bulguksa Temple complex from the parking lot, you walk through a serene park-like environment.  You pass through a couple of gates and by the Pond of Banya before reaching the temple complex.  You’ll need to walk up a number of steps to go into the temple complex.  There are two stone pagodas and several buildings containing Buddha statues."
"a very classic historic site A must go if you visit Gueongju. A very traditional temple area with many local families enjoying themselves, but still not crowded. Would be good if you have some guidebooks / a tour guide, to understand more clearly about the history."
"Beautiful grounds, breathtaking temple Lots of ground to cover here.  Wear comfortable shoes.  Temple grounds are very well maintained.  Landscaping compliments temple.  I would highly recommend visiting.  Great for all travelers.  Some temples require a hike or up mts but these grounds are flat, easy walking but beautiful."
"Highlight of Gyeongju visit Rather extensive grounds with a number of beautiful statues scattered throughout the complex. One of the best temples we’ve seen in Korea, well worth the trek. The temple opens at 7am and it is best to go early before the tour groups swarm the place. You can catch the # 10 or 11 from Gyeongju, takes up to 50 mins but first thing in the morning we got there in about 30 mins."
"Day trip to the Bulguksa temple Enjoyed the walk to the temple, looking at the stone structures. A must visit if you are at Gyeongju and into history. However, need to take note of the transport. The place is quite far in and the buses will only come at about every hour interval. There is a sign board at the entrance of the temple so you need to check it out and time yourself if you don't want to miss the bus. A must visit to Seokguram grotto if you are there. It is a just nearby, about five minute ride."
One-day trip from Busan We took intercity bus from Nopo subway st. (line 1) to Geyongju and then changed to the local bus no 11 to Bulguksa(10 also goes to the temple). You can also take intercity bus to Geyongju from Sasang subway st. (line 2) but I m not sure how frequent the buses are from there. It took us about 3 hours to get to the temple from Haeundae subway station.
"Nice historical temple; but overcrowded and gaudy lanterns It was hard to enjoy a temple when it was overcrowded, and on weekends yes popular temples with UNESCO World Heritage credentials will get crowded.  But I found the gaudy lanterns (well they are not peculiar to this temple to be fair) not to my taste really.  Hard to dispute the beauty of the temple themselves or their historical and cultural significance, but also hard to really enjoy the visit."
UNESCO World Heritage Site. History and stunning scenery.
"A representative temple of the Silla period. You can see stone buildings of the Shilla period with a wonderful curve. If you visit Gyeongju and do not see Bulguksa temple, it is like you have not visited Gyeongju. When you visit Bulguksa, I recommend you to see Seokguram Buddha statue nearby."
"A holiday highlight It`s one and a half hour drive from Busan.  We visited this beautiful temple with a lovely knowledgeable guide.  Unusual weather conditions made this a holiday highlight.  Yesterday it had snowed but today it was sunny. The colours of the woodwork of the temple against the blue sky and white snow was stunning and the just opened cherry blossom added to the  picture. We were early and it was not too busy.  Our guide told us the history and brought the site to life as we walked along.  There were rows of red lanterns for Buddhas birthday with many messages, which was very special.  Good gift shop."
"The most beautifull temple of Korea This Is the most beautifull temple of Korea.In a nice area jou can have a walk around the buildings.  I found the lanterns a pitty.  We were here 10 years ago,  and without lanterns the view was beyter Very Important Site, But Busy Obviously this is one of the most important temples in Korea, so you ought to see it.  Just note that it is often really crowded.  Moreover, it is often really crowded with high school and university students screaming at the top of their lungs.  Not the best atmosphere for a temple.  You might want to check your Google Maps application to see when it is least crowded and plan your visit accordingly.Tip:  if you want to save time getting to Seokguram Grotto you can skip the bus and hunt around for someone to share a taxi with in the temple parking lot.  Expect to pay about 10 000 won or so in total."
The highlights are the cherry blossoms on top of the UNESCO temple We were fascinated by the cherry blossoms upon arrival at the site. Numerous tourists surrounded the cherry trees shooting photos. The blossoms are of pink colour and petals are multiple which make them look better than anywhere else in Korea. The temple itself is huge but worth walking around at leisure.
"Beautiful but busy We first tried to visit on Saturday at around 11am, but the traffic was queuing back out of the car park. A lot were there for the cherry blossom park not the templeWe went back at 8.30am the following day and things were much less hectic, though there were already lots of people in the parkThe temple is wonderful, built on lots of levels around several courtyards it is definitely worthy of its World Heritage status Nice walk but extremely crowded with tourists This place is easily more crowded than Gyeongbukgung in Seoul. But it is a beautiful walk and most explanations along the way are in several languages."
Beautiful temple Since we walked into the temple. Beside us was Sakura. A lot of Sakura!! Very beautiful. In the temple. there's pond..very nice. And the temple is very beautiful. The lamps were pretty. But we had to wait for a long time for bus to go back to the city.
"To appreciate the temple, visit with a local friend This beautiful temple harbors many national treasures. To truly appreciate it, visit the temple with a local friend (I guess a local tour guide would also do the trick).And don't forget to walk up the mountain to the Buddha cave."
"Photography + Spirituality Set on spacious grounds, this temple complex is a joy to visit, no matter whether you're religious or not at all inclined.From the serene surrounding garden grounds to the ornate carvings on the buildings, there's no shortage of things to see and marvel.It's a fantastic location if you enjoy photography as there's no shortage of photo opportunities throughout.An absolute must visit destination!"
"Respectful, Beautiful, Functioning Temple Absolutely worth the bus ride and hike. Know that this is a functioning Temple, so be respectful.  There are limits on pictures inside, but there are plenty of lovely sights to enjoy.  Give yourself plenty of time to walk around and know the timing of the buses.  Good recommendation - if you want to go up to the Grotto, know when the bus is going up, so you can time your visits.  We loved taking the bus up and walking down from the Grotto, through the National Park, back to the Temple."
Nice and loved it!
"It was so nice to walked in the temple inside and outside of the place,though its a long walk from the bus stop up to the temple.We ride the bus no. 700 in going to Bulguksa temple back and forth to Singgyeongju station before heading to Busan."
"Beautiful and special Well preserved Buddhist temple  well kept by nuns. Unique Buddha statues amazing garden. We came while cherry trees were blossoming so the gardens around the temple were all white. it was one of the most amazing nature scenes we have ever seen. in Beautiful scenic temple compound A few temples there and beautiful scenery. Legend says there is a wild boar staying at the temple and touching the golden wild boar will bring luck to yourself Beautiful Temple This temple is so well preserved and enjoyable to walk around.The skills of the craftsmen that built this, is simply amazing."
"Beauty of Silla It was truly amazing! So epic!! I loved being there i cant explain its beauties... just moved by its philosophy and the way of expression.. this place has many hidden stories and legends ..please study little bit before you visit this gorgeous temple. You will feel it in a totally different way. I fell in love with ‘seok-ga tower’ Such an elegance  , perfect simplicity and modernism in it..."
"Enjoyable Buddhist Temple Experience The trip will take about 1 to 2 hours to complete. Parking was 1,000 won and entrance fee was 5,000 won per adult. The temple is very nice but needs to have some paint work done. Overall, a great experience and definitely worth the fee."
"Very pretty temple This is a large and beautiful temple set against a backdrop of mountains and forest. It was pretty busy (I think due to a national holiday the day before, which I'm guessing led to long weekends) but not uncomfortably so. The grounds are reasonably large and it was nice for a gentle wander around. No photos are allowed of the interiors of the various prayer rooms.I caught the #10 bus from outside the express bus terminal and it took about 30 minutes at a cost of 1,700 won. I believe the #11 takes a similar time. Entrance fee was 5,000 won (reasonable).The walk up to Seokguram Grotto from Bulguksa is very nice although steep in parts - it took me just under an hour to the grotto itself. Better than waiting for another bus."
National Treasure in Korea This is a national treasure in Korea and worth a visit. We went in wintertime and it was serene and peaceful. I'm sure it is much more hectic and touristy in the springtime so I was lucky to go when there were not many people. The grounds and the temple along with the water features and view over the mountains make a spectacular setting.
Korea’s Treasure. Gold. DIAMOND.
"A wonderful site to visit. What? Not into bhuddism? Doesn’t matter. I’m an aethiest and was absolutely blown when I saw the Vatican City. You will, too, after visiting here."
"Wonderful temple It is a very beautiful temple and it is easy to reach with the bus. But for me, I found It a little too touristic."
2nd Time in Bulguksa I told myself I would go back here. Last time it was spring so I said I should visit during autumn season. I specifically love the beauty of the pond beside the temple and the mixture of autumn colors. I took bus no. 11 from Gyeongju train station and got off at Bulguksa Temple. I think bus no. 11 has less stops hence faster.
"Belongs to top three temples in South Korea Bulguksa, Haeinsa and Gyeongbok Palace in Seoul are the top three temples in South Korea. Nice Location and special atmosphere..Watch the stone construction of the  main wall which makes the temple more stable against earthquakes. Women in traditional dresses spent Lotus tee for free and even gave us the two white Lotus shaped bowls for free. Touch the bronze pig and you will get rich Calm n fresh air Good place to visit w/ family. Well paved area w/ fresh air.Takes 30 min. from Kyungju city center.Also close to the Gampo beach 30min distance from there.If you are not interested in the Buddist temple, the beach is also good option to you."
"Gorgeous grounds and temple The grounds surrounding the temple, as well as the temple buildings themselves, were absolutely stunning with red leaves. Just near the bridges is a well spring where you can drink refreshing water from one of two streams.Inside the temple is very peaceful. My friend made the mistake of trying to take a picture while inside one of the buildings; I'm thankful that the worker who reminded us not to do so was so kind about it.Around (I believe) Nahanjeon is an area with many many piles of stacked rocks, which was really cool and made for some pretty pictures. Souvenirs at the shop are plentify and quite beautiful, but if you're wearing a backpack I would suggest asking if they can keep it at the counter to avoid knocking anything over. The workers there are /extremely/ helpful and very kind about it to boot, and honestly good for them, considering where the proceeds go."
Very beautiful Very nice place. I would say one of the best ones we visited in Korea. Highly recommend. Make sure to wear comfortable shoes.
"Nice place to visit, especially in autumn We took the #10 bus to the temple for around 30minutes from downtown.  A bit of a walk from the bus stop, and you'll find the place.  There's an entrance fee of 5000won each.We went when it was early, so there were not too many people, just a lot of student groups on a field trip.  You can spend a most 2hours and you're done."
"Beautiful temple and gardens Visited this place on a Sat early morning in late Oct. Less people and more peaceful. Leaves were still green and yellowish (tot they would had turn red). But temple and its surrounding areas are still beautiful.We took bus #11 but I did not check how much is the bus fare as we used t-money card. Covered the whole area in 2.5 hours as we stopped very frequently to snap pictures..:). There are 2 path to the temple. We took the one that lead to the gardens and pond first. There are some food and souvenir stalls along this path.  Glad we visited this place early in the morning. When we left the place late morning, lots of cars and visitors arriving."
Lovely peaceful park and castle Went here in autumn- so beautiful to see the colour turning on the leaves. It was nice to walk around the old palace grounds.We purchased a bell from the lady selling souvenirs in the middle of the grounds - it was much cheaper than the same souvenir from the souvenir shop near the big bell.You can buy a wish or blessing that you hang from one of the many lanterns hanging in the area.A great visit.
Beautiful temple close to the mountain to visit Beautiful temple may not be the most spectacular of South Korea but it deserves to be visited. To get there you will need a car or take a bus because it is on foot from the mountain (30 minutes drive).
"Magnificent Unesco Heritage Site A visit to Bulguksa Temple is a must for lovers of history or architecture. It is the crown jewel of the Shilla Kingdom's architecture and yes, is on Unesco's World Cultural Heritage List. The building is gorgeous, the setting, lovely and the artistry, magnificent. I left with admiration for the carpenters and the painters of the Shilla Kingdom. Highly recommended."
"Attractive temple It is a great blend of tourist attraction and an authentic temple experience. Saw some of the monks actually conducting some prayers, and a lot of people (mostly locals) did a bit of praying on each of the altar. A bit of a hike, but not terrible. Go here in the morning, I feel it's more serene that way."
Interesting place to go.
"We took the bus here. It's easy to find as it's the last stop. The entry fee is 5,000 krw. We really enjoyed the free English tour. The guide was very informative. She explained many things about Buddism and the different Buddha's in the complex."
"A famous, need to see, temple We had an English speaking guide provided free by the ticket/information office. The guide gave us a much better understanding of the temple layout, buildings, and operation than if we had walked around on our own. This is a famous temple in Korea and should be visited if possible. A lot of temples in Korea, including Bulguksa, have been partially (and in some more severe cases almost fully) rebuilt following destruction or damage by the Japanese over the centuries."
"Fantastic temple Beautifully preserved temple, just outside Gyeongju's historic area, but nevertheless the main reason for most people to visit the city/area. Nice tranquil area with a series of gold Buddha's. Not something you want to miss when you're in the area, but try to avoid school classes of annoyed adolescents..."
Great visit This temple (world heritage site) is around a 20 minute drive from the main city area but it is well worth it. At 5000 KRW it's a bit pricey (for gyeongju) but it is definitely worth the price. There is a lot of history steeped in this world heritage site and a lot of photo opportunities too. Great for the family too. Recommend it.
"Korean Buddhist Temple This temple is okay and worth visiting.  Notable are the gold Buddha's and Boddhisatvas, painted rafters, fish and drum in the courtyard of the main pavilion and of course the main stairways leading up and verandas sticking out.  Don't forget to capture that vista on the way out as you might not notice it from the path in - the dramatic stone stairways are steep and closed to visitor foot traffic."
'Working' temple in beautiful setting.
"Kept in as original condition as possible, Bulguska is an active temple with prayers conducted regularly. Set in a tranquil setting, the surrounding gardens are well maintained and are worth wandering around after visiting the temple. But it is the temple complex itself which captures the eye. It is beautifully proportioned and balanced with its natural surrounds and is somewhat different in grandeur from similarly constructed temples. The trip out is also pleasant enough and you do get to see a variety of amusement and themed parks, large resorts and and hotel complexes that seem to exist separately from the main town of Gyeongju."
Great place A big temple kept in original form. Very nice and well maintained. I adore the architecture and colors. It is a great place to see and well worth it.
Been Here Twice & Still Love It!
"The first time I visited Bulguksa was when I was a teenager. And so when I came back as an adult, it was just as mesmerizing and beautiful as I had remembered it. This temple was a favorite of mine in my youth so it was a great feeling to come back and witness just how great I had remembered it to be.Bulguksa is large in location, so make sure to having your comfortable sneakers on before visiting. There's a lot of walking involved. There is absolutely so much to see and tour inside. This whole temple is filled with Korea's National Treasures and you shouldn't want to miss any of that. Whether it's the pagodas, the ancient but vastly colorful decor, or the amazing architecture of historical Korea, Bulguksa is a sight you don't want to ever miss. Enjoy!"
Beautiful woodwork We were moved by the fantastic wood works and the temples below.There isn't much walking so a good thing to do after two days trekking.We recommend to visit it.
"THIS IS THE ESSENCE OF KOREAN ARCHITECTURE AND BEAUTY This is an absolute place you must visit in this beautiful historical city, Gyeongju. I fell in love with this city. Most of all, this temple is an unbelievable combinations of cutting edge science, geometry, architecture and art of that time. They provide every hour expert guides' free explanation.Make sure you make use of it. While I was listening them, I was astonished by people of that time and heritages they achieved. You can't help but to love this place more."
"One of my Favorites There's a lot of temples in this part of the world, but Bulguksa will always be one of my favorites.  It feels like a palace and the craftsmanship is fantastic.  Great wood work, great stone work and great paintings.  Try not to get overwhelmed by the crowds and take the time to look at some of the details of the construction.  Some of the best parts are the subtle ones like the details in the roofing and contrast between the straight edged stone slabs and the boulders.  The location is also stunning and you should take a little time to enjoy the mountains."
True essence!
"If you think no more tombs, no more temples, you should go Bulguksa, it's a must thing. Look at the side of 10 eon coin. You can see a real pagoda here. Beautiful architecture which stands here for hundreds thousands of year. Summer in here is hot and humid as it's in the middle of Toham mountain. But you won't regret to come here. (I know jogyesa in Seoul is also beautiful but Bulguksa is more like a historical art.) Peace in the atmosphere A must visit for this region , a world  heritage site , extremely well preserved , be ready for a good walk if u want to explore it for the fullest Must see You must see this beautiful place when you are in Gyeongju.  Lots of things to see and great place to just walk around.  The way the temple is built and surrounding grounds are spectacular!"
Beautiful temple complex Very interesting historic temple complex in Gyeongju. We came here on a tour and found it very worthwhile . I particularly liked the male and female pagodas. They look quite small when you are on their level but as you progress up the levels you get a different perspective and realise how large they are! Six temples are on the site and all different and interesting in their own right. Recommended !
A definite must go when visiting gyeongju Location is a little far out from the main town but very accessible via their public bus. The temple in overall makes people feel really at peace when visiting as they housed various Buddhas. Would definitely recommend people to visit as it showcases a scenic and interesting overview of the Korea culture comparatively to those palaces seen in Seoul.
Serene and relaxing UNESCO World Heritage site of Bulguksa temple!
"Bulguksa temple is a must-see in Gyeongju. We took a bus from Gyeongju bus station and it was a long ride, but we were discussing our excursions and experiences with fellow passengers in the bus, so the ride didn't feel long at all. The temple is beautiful and is generally busy. Despite there being moderate crowd on the day of our visit, it was not at all chaotic. The temple is nestled in a very beautiful, green habitat; there's also a lake closeby. I was fascinated by the prayer candles that were placed in the ceiling throughout the temple perimeter."
"Easy day trip from Haeundae, Busan A relatively compact temple complex set in the hills.  All though most of it was rebuilt or restored it is still a beautiful working temple.We were staying in Haeundae, Busan and did a day trip to the temple and Gyeongju.  We were able to catch a regional train from Shin-haeundae station to Bulguksa (1hr 20min ₩5,000). Once in Bulguksa town there is plenty of taxis and bus stops. A taxi to the main entrance is  ₩5,000 or its about a 4km walk uphill.If you take the south entrance on the way out, and walk back up to the shops near the temple there is a tourist information centre.  They gave us maps of Gyeongju and also bus information.  Buses into Gyeongju run every 15 -20 mins. We got bus 10,  which did seem to stop at a few small towns along the way and took about 30 mins and tickets were ₩1,700."
"Relax trip Took bus near sugar hotel, can ask the front desk how to take the bus, stop the roadside just walk follow by signboard, big areas with lots of trees Heavenly.. Stunning..!!"
The temple is well maintained despite of being hundreds of years old. The surrounding sceneries are awesome. Describing heaven on earth. You should drink the natural spring water which you'll find on your way to that temple. I will always want to go there again..!!
"Best Temple in Korea Strongly recommend! Alone, with friends, with family.. this place would be one of the perfect attractions during your stay in Korea. Actually the city itself where the temple is located is a historic and memorable place. If you travel or stay in Korea for a while, visit here!"
"Highlight of Gyeongju How to get to Belguksa temple Gyeongju.Take buses 10, 11 from outside the tourist office close to the bus station or as they pass through centre of town for ~30 minute trip to the drop off.Wonderfully restored colourful grand temple with many parts to wander through. Information boards add to your enjoyment and appreciation.Thanks for the vote if you found this review helpful."
Beautiful temple It's a very beautiful place to see. We get there in the morning but there were already many tourists.It easy to get there you can take the bus number 11 and it's not really far away.I think the price is a little bit expensive but again it's a tourist attraction.The monk were praying at the time we visited so it was really nice.
International Tournament for Martial Arts. The tournament will be next week and there will be 36 countries.
"Good, the place was clean, peaceful and not very strict with the tourist. It was hot when we visited the temple but the breeze made it relaxing and comfortable."
"Incredibly Beautiful Ancient Temple Complex The temple is a long bus ride from the Singyeongjyu train station. It is probably closer to the Gyeonjyu train station but we did not have a choice. It is a huge complex & there is a lot of climbing up & down of stairs. This is tough if you are tired and if the day is hot. I recommend getting there as early in the day as you can when you are feeling well-rested. It is definitely worth visiting/ Beautiful Temple In 1955 this was dedicated a UNESCO WORLD HERITAGE Site, so you know that it is worth spending time here, which we did.  Built in the 8th century, partially destroyed in the16th century by invading Japanese during a battle, it was reconstructed faithfully in 1970.  It is considered a masterpiece of Buddhist architecture.  This is very impressive!"
"Its huge This is an amazing complex.. It was all tarted up with hanging coloured lanterns to celebrate a special occasion apparently.There were temples everywhere, monks and nuns walking and praying and chanting.The gardens were kept immaculately by people sweeping paths with straw brooms.Also there were little squirrels? running all through the stone blocks of the temples..Such a great place.."
My favorite temple visited in South Korea This temple is a thing of beauty!  There are multiple buildings open with active praying going on inside.  There are some very steep and uneven steps throughout the area so it may not be very accessible for people with mobility issues.  Put this on your bucket list for South Korea.
"Not a mosque, interesting but not worth the trouble The bulguksa temple is located 10 miles outside of central Gyeongju. It's a nice temple but as far as temples go it isn't that special when you consider the time the trip takes (40 min, depending on the location of your hotel). Of course if you haven't seen many temples this one has the wow factor but there are many simular temples in Korea (2 in Seoul for instance). So if you don't have the time don't feel to sad about missing it. The two pagodas that are world heritage can also be seen at the museum of Gyeongju  (replicas) and admission to the museum unlike the temple is free. And if you go for the Buddha in the grotto, there is a replica there too as that particular attraction is totally overrated."
"Masterpiece of the Silla kingdom Bulguksa is considered as a masterpiece of the golden age of Buddhist art in the Silla kingdom( King Beopheung in 528).This temple encompasses seven National treasures of South Korea, including the Dabotap and Seokgatap stone pagodas and two gilt-bronze statues of Buddha.The temple is classified as Historic and Scenic Site No. 1 by the South Korean government.In 1995, Bulguksa was added to the UNESCO World Heritage List together with the Seokguram Grotto, which lies four kilometers to the east."
"Average Sightseeing It took about 30min from Singyeongju Station (KTX). After exiting station, turn right and head for bus stop. (There is another bus stop for tour bus.) Take bus #700. For weekdays, the bus does not ends here. Tell the driver ""temple"" if you not sure where to alight. The temple is up-slope when you alight."
"Beautiful and Serene Buddhist Temple A large complex of temple buildings, bell, and courtyard. Several buildings with Buddhas.  Very old stone pagodas.  It is nice to walk around here to enjoy the trees and architecture. When I was here, there was an exhibit of paintings done by students - fun."
A must A must visit as it is a very very iteresting temple in which you can spend enough time. It is worth the drive out.
Large temple The temple is located in large park. This is very relaxing area. We also ordered tea- jujube. It is awful. We didn't like it at all. The temple is beautiful.
"Inexpensive and picturesque Although many temples in Korea have a similar feel, Bulguksa still has a lot of charm. It's inexpensive for all you can experience here. It has many places you can take a picture at. You can take a picture from various angles of the lake: on the bridge, below it and across the lake, or long distance shots of the bridge. Then you walk to the temple and see how old the staircases are, continue up the hill, and take pictures of the two pagodas just outside the temple. You can view one temple there, take a picture of the wooden doors, and continue to the other temple. If you go in May, you can see colorful lanterns celebrating Buddha's birthday. Finally, you can see a rock garden where Buddhists make their wishes."
"Beautiful temple and park We drove 2.5 hours to visit this, I was well worth it. I strongly suggest visiting the temple and surrounding Parks. Taking an English tour with the temple is recommended."
"Awe Inspiring If you have an interest in the origins of Buddhism in Korea then this will both humble you and make your day. This site is very impressive and each of the temples is magnificent with their gold Buddha icons and tankas, not to mention the ornate and detailed painted interiors and exteriors. The grounds are impeccably kept and overall this was a truly worthwhile excursion."
"A well laid out Buddhist temple There is a lot to see at Bulguksa, and the price is only ￦5000. Many of the shrines have large Buddhist statues and the buildings themselves are fascinating."
An enjoyable World Heritage Site It was rather busy during the week celebrating Buddha's birthday. Much of the complex has been repainted. Most people go on to visit the Seokguram Grotto but the view of the stone Buddha is restricted and no photography is allowed.
"Good place Bulguksa is located on the slopes of mount Toham (Jinheon-dong, Gyeongju city, North Gyeongsang province, South Korea). It is a head temple of the Jogye Order of Korean Buddhism and encompasses seven National treasures of South Korea, including the Dabotap and Seokgatap stone pagodas, Cheongun-gyo (Blue Cloud Bridge), and two gilt-bronze statues of Buddha. The temple is classified as Historic and Scenic Site No. 1 by the South Korean government.[1] In 1995, Bulguksa was added to the UNESCO World Heritage List together with the Seokguram Grotto, which lies four kilometers to the east."
"Bulguksa temple visit after work One of UNSECOs safeguarded sites,Pretty colorful as a place with quite a bit of history. One can see the Buddhist worshipping as well within the temple.Quite a few good pictures can be captured within the area."
"UNESCO Preserved Site Built in the year 528, the name of the temple is literally translated as ""Temple of Buddha's Land"". It aims to realize the blissfulness of the Buddhist scriptures where the mortal being's suffering is being released."
"Beautiful temple in a beautiful area Very nice to walk around and quite beautiful temple to see.  It is quite a pity that there were lots of refurbishments when we went to visit, but on the other hand, at least the place is being taken care of. And that's quite important!We possibly spent over an hour and a half enjoying the views and the setting.  Very nice place to see on a sunny day !!"
"A beautiful temple in a beautiful setting We were here in the late afternoon in spring and it was beautiful. It is very well maintained, the paths are good and the signage excellent. The gardens are beautiful and in the late afternoon the atmosphere was incredibly tranquil. well worth a visit."
"Beautiful temple and grounds This is a really stunning temple complex, set in beautiful grounds. I was lucky to go during cherry blossom season and there is a park full of cherry trees which looked amazing.  It is a working temple and there were prayers/ceremonies occurring throughout the day which you could observe or take part in."
"Recommended temple tour and shopping Temple was cultural highlight of our tour day along with Gyeongju National Museum.  The entry features four wooden statues.  Inside, the souvenir kiosk was very popular and open to discount bulk buying .. we bought a golden dragon.  Lots of good photo opportunities.  The cherry blossoms were in bloom .. best views were to the left of the entry."
"Very well-preserved temple especially in April The Bulguksa Temple in Gyeongju is a great place to stop by if driving along the east coast of S. Korea or as a half-day trip from Busan (about 1.5 hours' drive North). Ample parking, good signage in English and beautifully decorated with colourful lanterns in April and May for Buddha's birthday."
"Best attraction in Gyeongju This temple and its grounds are gorgeous. I visited during spring and the park between the carpark and temple was filled with cherry blossoms. The temple has a serene atmosphere with some lovely old pine trees and a pond. I've been to Kyoto a few times and of all the Korean temples I've visited, Bulguksa most closely resembles the major temples of Kyoto. Definitely a must do if you're in the area."
"Beautifull cherry blossom Beautifull cherry blossom, lots of walk. Free tour guide. You can take bus no 10, 11 or 700 to go to Bulguksa. And when you want to return to Gyeongju, just wait at the bus stop that you had arrived. Don't ever cross the street, wait there will be forever."
Far from the madding crowd!
This Unesco World Heritage site is steeped in culture and history. The entire area of temples and garden is well maintained and one of the most scenic and serene places I have been to.
"No wonder it's a world heritage site Fascinating place to visit and well worth it for an encompassing glimpse into the past. The layout and monks praying in he different buildings contribute to a unique experience. Very easy to get to from downtown by bus 10 11 or 700. Entry was 5,000. There is a small snack shop on site with teas mostly and street food along the access paths to the temple. Otherwise if you're peckish there are many restaurants and coffee shops by the main road where the bus stops are located. Enjoy !"
Beautiful temple We really enjoyed our trip here. It is a little way out of Gyeongju but definitely well worth the trip. Lovely coffee shop next to the bus stop.
"well preserved large complex of historic structuresbeautiful settinga number of shrinesactive Buddhismlots of locals come to visit nice temple quite a distance from Gyeongju city, i took bus #11 from the opposite of bus terminal and it took almost 40mins to reach. got off the bus at the parking lot and head to the information centre to get a map. you can also get the bus timetable to Seokoram here. got there right before the noon, just nice to avoid the crowd. it isn't very big so i had a quick look before heading to Seokoram. i visited in February when it was still bit chilly, but my guess is that it will look spectacular in Spring/Autumn."
"Historically place Must go there in April and Autumn time,  because there are full of cherry blossom trees and maple tree.  Easy to reach by bus and a large car park proivide. Outside the Temple, there are lots of restaurants."
Fascinating temple in lovely setting This was the first stop on a Cunard cruise ship tour from Busan and well worth a visit particularly with an excellent tour guide as we had.I will let the photos speak for themselves as they give a good variety of the sights to be seen.We had a couple of hours here and you could spend more time on a nice day just enjoying the tranquillity of the place.
Well worth a visit Gyeongju is a very attractive area and the setting for the temple is beautiful. There was few people at the temple while we were there. It was a cool but sunny day and cherry blossoms were just starting. I can only imagine how beautiful the site will be when the trees are in leaf and the plants are in full blossom. It is well worth while setting aside an hour to visit the temple and surrounding area.
"Nice Nice place. I guess in autumn or summer it looks even better.Strangely there were no guides (neither volunteers like in Seoul).Shame that they put souvenir shops in the middle of the temple area. Would have been ok just outside the gate, but inside?!We liked it and would have liked it more if not for all the loud tourists.And why on earth they sell whistles in the temple area???"
