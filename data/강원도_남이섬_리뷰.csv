One Must Go!
"If in Seoul one must go. Very romantic and extra ordinary place in this planet ..So much to do so spend some full day ..Clay museum is very fascinating...lol Beautiful autumn foliage While the autumn foliage on Nami Island is lovely, you must be prepared to put up with the hordes of tourists that pour in on day trips. Starting from the road leading to the ferry terminal to Nami Island, snaking queue of cars have to wait patiently for carpark lots. Next will be the queue for the ferry. While everything moved fairly quickly and efficiently, it does mar the experience somewhat. It will probably be more enjoyable if one spends the night or arrives very early to beat the crowds."
"From Seoul to Serenity: A Day on Nami Island Nami Island is a charming and peaceful escape from the busy city life. Surrounded by nature, it offers beautiful tree-lined paths, scenic river views, and a calm, romantic atmosphere. Each season brings its own magic, from cherry blossoms in spring to colorful leaves in autumn. It’s a lovely spot for walking, taking photos, and enjoying simple pleasures in nature."
Nami Island - yeah Was great to see the island and nature. Wish I could have seen blossoms! This was worth it for at least once. Very touristy also.
"A Scenic Escape Influenced by K-Drama A visit to Nami Island was pretty much non-negotiable for us; my wife, sisters, and niece are all huge K-drama fans, so it was bound to happen. We visited in August, on a sweltering August afternoon (the humidity in Seoul is no joke!) as part of a tour. The hour drive from the city and subsequent short ferry ride over was a nice escape from the city.Nami Island is named after General Nami; a figure who fought courageously but, tragically, died at 26. History aside, once on the island, we found it quite busy, for a weekday, but not unbearably so; I can imagine what weekends are like. The place has a whimsical charm, filled with manicured gardens, art installations, and winding trails under pine trees that give you a break from the heat. Despite a lot of the landscaping being man-made, it feels surprisingly natural.Exploring Nami doesn’t take too long; we did so in two hours on foot and eventually renting electric scooters. Some of our party took up some boat activities. We passed by a few cafés and restaurants (mostly Korean cuisine), so you won’t go hungry or thirsty.Is it a romantic haven? Maybe, if you catch it on a quieter day. For us, it was more about soaking in a bit of nature, taking family photos (with some members going wild with Instagram pics), and ticking that K-drama box. If you’re in Seoul and want an easy day trip out of town, Nami Island offers exactly that—just be prepared for the humidity if you visit in the thick of summer."
"beware of pickpockets on Nami Island place is beautiful but becareful of pickpockets .Of all places ..my daugther lost her handphone to pickpockets.It was inside her handbag.We travelled safely to places like Thailand ,Vietnam ,Cambodia,China and Europe and it's so disappointing to have lost it to a pickpocket in Korea ..of all places.Even the crowded streets of Myeongdong was safer.Pickpockets should be targeting tourists...He/she was very fast to escape via the ferry and was soon transferring between train stations further and further away.It's my 3rd visit to this beautiful country..very disappointed and lodging a police report is another hassle.Not many spoke English.In the end,I lodge the report at Incheon Airport Great for a walk and enjoy the scenery Nami island is only a short ferry ride away and it is to spend half a day exploring the island. The scenery is beautiful and we can still see some autumn leaves. There are small cafes and shops along the way and you can even rent a bicycle. I would love to visit it again during spring."
"Must visit places ❄️ Nami island is a beautiful place to visit and photos of the islands 🏝️Prepare more times for yourself and family or friends here and the island is so much convenient for you to have fun, food and souvenir 🎁 Small island with lots of big old trees A tiny island. Pretty and good for spend a afternoon but not as pretty as expected. Full of beautiful and big trees but also has some tiny bugs flying around. It is easy to identify that there were many k drama were filmed there.Besides ferry, there is an alternative to cross the river to arrive the island, zip line, and it seems very fun.The island has some art pieces around.Don't be rush if you want to go there. You may need to wait for two ferries for your return.There are many clean toilets on the island.There is a beautiful Starbucks on your way to the ferry pier which you may not want to miss too."
SKIP this one.
Tourist trap.  This is where they filmed some of the scenes in k-drama “Winter Sonatas”. Your ticket gives you the round trip boat ride to this tiny island in the middle of the river. The boat ride takes about 5 minutes each way. There are places to drink and eat on this island.  I have been to municipal parks that are better than this.  AVOID.  Most visitors are foreigners.

"Our tour guides made this a wonderful trip Our tour guides made this an excellent experience. The reviews for Nami Island was mixed at best so we started out with some doubts. Our tour guides Tomas and Alex met us with bright smiles in a rainy day. They explained the day. They were upbeat, encouraging and very attentive. They got us there early so we were almost the only folks in the ferry boat. It was a short trip to the island but it was beautiful. Their descriptions of the history of the place made it come even more alive. We had the island almost to ourselves. The rain had almost stopped by the time we got to the island so we were able to explore, take pictures, ask questions to our heart’s content. We had a wonderful lunch in an almost empty restaurant then we were on to the Garden of Morning Calm. That place was absolutely idyllic. Tomas and Alex walked around the well thought out, planned a d executed grounds that look like they effortlessly appeared that way by nature (or fairy dust). We saw ostrich and peacock. There were fountains and babbling brooks and waterfalls. The peacefulness crept into your soul.I thank VIP tours and especially Tomas and Alex for a truly memorable day!"
"Go for nature and any k-drama fans Having been in the region I thought I'd check out this well known Nami Island.I did some quick research and decided that it probably wasn't going to be for me, not being overly familiar with k-drama.The place gets very crowded and very difficult to take photos at times. But the island itself surprisingly is actually quite nice, think about it like a large picturesque park. Gardens are well maintained and designed and some really nice scenary around the island.It does take a little while to walk around and I allowed 2 hours to completely explore the island quickly. It was worth it, but I wouldn't go out of my way to visit here. For a relaxing half day trip from Seoul it's really not too bad but don't expect much.You can rent bicycles and electric vehicles to get around the island quicker but for the unitiated it's probably too much of a hype and not really worth it.I enjoyed my experience mostly nevertheless."
"Must visit Very beautiful place. Recommend everyone to visit this place if you are coming to Seoul.They have options to go around the island like a family bike, Segway or a bicycle.We also attended a live music performance. It was very nice and my kid enjoyed it.Very scenic place and you can take beautiful spots for taking photos."
"Peaceful Nami island is bigger than I expected. Don't expect to be entertained while here or else you'll be disappointed. It's a very relaxing and peaceful spot. Lots of scenic areas. It's incredible how many tents were set up. I guess some people like to camp on the island. There are also some lodges and hard roofs over your head if you wish to stay on the island. There are a few restaurants. My recommendation is to pay for a golf cart tour around the island instead of the mini train through the island. The former takes about 30 minutes. Once you've returned to your starting point, you can stroll through the island. Overall, it would take around 2-3 hours."
"Spent a nice 2 hours Came here on a day tour from SeoulNice area. The ticket gives you a return trip by ferry.I ended up with about 2 hours probably would have liked 3 hours.I got to do the main loop of the island. Well set up for visitors. Beautiful natural areas, plenty of places to eat and buy souvenesThere are hotels to stay at and plenty of actives to get involved with.You could easily spend the whole day here if you want."
"Grossly overrated, noisy and crowded Fortunately the island was more or less on our way and we did not make a special trip there. It is certainly not worth it and even hardly a visit when passing by. Actually it is just a crowded park with admittedly nice nature but spoilt by the crowds and music all around. You can see the same in many other places."
"Beautiful place to visit It’s a beautiful place with lots to see and to do. It’s worth a trip if you’re visiting Korea.  Even though it’s a bit pricey, there are many places to eat. I went on a weekend so it was a bit crowded but didn’t have to wait to get on a short ferry ride."
"Zipwire thrill, pretty island We got buses and trains there.I'd advise a cab to/from Gapyeong Station to the ferry/zipwire. If you travel via that station.It saves waiting for the bus and also being wedged on the bus. I didn't think they could fit anymore people on the bus. ..until they did.The trip felt like a fair bit of travel from Myeong-dong, Seoul for a day trip that was simply ok. But it would depend on what you are hoping to see or do.Lots of pretty nature walks. See some animals like chipmunks, peacocks, red squirrels, butterflies etc.Some bikes to hire. Some Swan shaped pedalos..some cafes and restaurantsSome art installations.The main reason for us visiting was to zipwire onto it. So for that reason alone- the daytrip there was worth it.We arrived at the  zipwire location. Bought tickets for the family zipwire (there is also a more adventurous faster zip wire to a different island)Waited about 40mins for our time slot and just browsed some shops.We were permitted to wear out rucksacks on our front whilst on then zipwire.It's about a minute or so of thrill seeking.It felt quite high and fast which was fun.Lovely views as you zip wire across the water.The rest of the island is pretty. Some great views. But it was very very busy.To ensure we had good weather - we went on a Saturday. Not only tourists present but locals too. It was also Holy Hai on the day. It was super busy. Lots of people. The ferries were packed. The cafes/restaurants were full.Had we known and done more research in advance we probably would have taken a small picnic/ bunch of snacks. Or even participated in Holy Hai as it looked like great fun.I also would have chosen to go on a weekday where we heard it is quieter.Overall a good day and good memories."
"Boring Sad to say it was one of the most boring places I have visited. Crushed into the boat to get there, nothing on the island to do, totally devoid of anything interesting and after 20 minutes wanted to leave. I suggest you really consider some place more worthwhile Thanks K Thanks K for this trip you are so professional and friendly. We enjoyed with her and we did all things on time as we expected."

Why Do People Love This Place?
"We have been here before, in Autumn, and the place was beautiful with yellow and red autumn leaves.  This time, we visited in late December and everything is bare.  There is no snow, only bare branches.  Doesn't look very attractive.  The famous lanes are crowded with people.  You can't really take a decent picture.Besides, it's really cold and not many places you can warm yourself up.Don't visit in winter (unless it has been snowing I guess?) Great venue to enjoy the beautiful autumn colours Another great venue to view autumn leaves with many opportunities to take beautiful photographs.  There are many nice cafes and resturants in the island where you can have a cup of coffee or meal and ice cream and just relax and take in the beautiful autumn colours.  We took a day tour from KKday to Garden of Morning Calm and then to Nami Island.  Our tour guide Cecilai was excellent.  Just before we took a ferry to the island, she brought to have lunch at a dakgalbi restaurant that was very good.  One of the highlights of our trip to Korea."
"Amazing place Nami Island should be in your list when you visit SoKor. The ambiance is truly exceptional. There’s a lot to see and experience in this small island. The art installations are mind-blowing! Truly, a worthy place to visit!"
Nice island visit but very crowded We visited here as part of a group and by the time we got there it was very busy on the island.The boats are frequent though. We only spent around 45 mins in the island which isn't really a lot of time so would recommend coming here on your own if you can so you are not rushing as part of a group with very limited time here.There is lots to see and plenty of spots to take Autumn 🍂 photos.There are some emus here too but they do not look very friendly so be careful if you have children.They have live music here too.
"Beautiful in autumn but beware of crowds It was beautiful in autumn. Like many other reviews mentioned, it is very crowded. The island was filled with both tourists and locals. There will always be a queue to board the ferry arriving or departing the island (you can also choose to zipline into the island instead of taking the boat).The crowds are mostly congregated along the famous path of trees. The island is huge and have a lot more nature to offer. I enjoyed exploring the island in autumn weather.There was also a Moomin exhibition and souvenir store during my time there. Not sure if this is a limited time or permanent arrangement."
"Nami Island Nov Visited Nami in November. Weather was kind to us with pretty cool temperature and no rain in our day of visit. Travel from Myeongdong to Gapyeong station took 2 hours. Be mindful you could be left standing on the TRX train if you buy your tickets on the spot. Either take a ferry or zip line to the island. Entrance fee to Nami is included in the ferry ticket price, hence there is no need to buy entrance ticket separately. Island was crowded but still beautiful despite the fact the leaves on the trees are not so colourful as expected in Autumn probably due to global climate change. There isn’t much of food variety around the jetty area on the mainland. Mostly offering Dakgalbi. We prefer taking the path by the riverside while on the island though taking the path in between rows of ginkgo trees is great too."
"Walk in the rain in Nami island Long journey from Seoul ,spend around 3hrs on the island with lunch in 1 of the restaurant. Didn't walk much but have a great time with my teens. Doing BBQ marshmallows in the DRIZZLE rain ."
Landscape!
"It's beautiful, there are some rabbits and squirrels running around. You'll need to take quick ferry trip to reach the island. Me and my wife went to the NAMI last September. We wished we could have visited mid October to see the full beauty of autumn surrounding the island. It was a good visit though it rained mid day. There are picture spots for the notable KDrama that filmed on the island ages ago. Lodging, restaurants and bike rentals are available for visitors."
"Give it a miss if you don't have enough time We joined the Nami Island tour and it's quite a rushed experience for us. The island has lots of activities like biking, performance and little cafes for lounging and quiet time. Most likely you will need at least half a day to cover this place. The place is beaming with tourists at every corner so it's hard if you're looking to take photos without people. I enjoy the scenic ferry ride to the place the most."
Nice Scenery It was a small island with a lovely scenery. I noticed so many SEA visitors. I visited here at winter I heard the scenery will change in every season.

"Luscious small island Lovely scenery, lots of facilities, beautiful overall. It is quite small though frankly, we spent 1.5h there and that was enough!Accessible easily by ferry, journey itself from the mainland only 5 minutesIf you’re there, I would definitely recommend trying the Hotteok at Sonata Cafe - it was warm and absolutely delicious! Of note though, it does contain pine nuts."
"Nami Island It's like a fairy tale come true! It's this dreamy island with trees that change colors in different seasons. You can walk or rent a bike and feel like you're in a storybook. There's yummy food too, and the air is so fresh. If you're up for some magic and nature vibes, Nami Island is where it's at! 🌳🍂🚴‍♂️ You don't miss it if you blink If you are a follower with K-drama, then this place is familiar to you. I love the avenue of trees, it's picture perfect if you can get a time where no one is around but fat chance. Would you miss it if you don't have the time, NO. There is nothing here if you have been to other picturesque sites Its just there.. if its meant for you, you will find it It was in April of 2023. We were hoping to catch the last full show of the cherry blossoms. Alas, our amiable tour guide told us we were a bit late. However, lady luck was with us. At Nari republic there was a tree with cherry blossoms in its full glory. It was in a hidden part of the park. So lovely. Hope to back in the near future."
You need to spend a day here!
"We took a 3 stops day tour which includes Nami island. And after visiting, we realized that 3 hours is really insufficient as although this is a small island, there is so much to do here and you could easily spend a full day here visiting libraries, eateries, museums, rides, cycling, visit k drama filming locations, etc. lots of photo opportunities. We will be back next time for a proper visit. Oh yea, as it gets cold during winter, there are several outdoor fire places where you can warm yourselves up. Really thoughtful!"
"Poetic & peaceful Beautiful place, clean, romantic, poetic and lovely.Many restaurants for different cuisines.1 day or half a day is enough so whenever you are next to this place, come enjoy the vibes !In springtime, I saw peacocks, squirrels and cute baby bunnies !Must be beautiful in autumn, because differents trees avenues and color palette."
"Never again. Stick to the treasures of Korea to visit I was expecting a lot more from the tour to Nami Island. When you are travelling on holidays from another country you look for places that will leave you will a memory or something you don't see in your own country. Nami Island is nothing more than a big botanical garden. You walk around don't see much, eat a little walk some more and that's it. For us 30 minutes and we wanted to leave. The crowds on the ferry were terrible. Long wait, crowded in like sardines and uncomfortable. To be honest it's not a place for the travelling tourist it is only famous for locals because a famous Korean series was made there so everyone goes to take the picture near the statue. The cost of the tour was not worth it. 8 hours in the bus from Seoul, no drinks or lunch provided....really disappointing."
"Avoid Tourist Traps in Korea, please!"
Traveling all the way to Korea and going to Nami Island is like traveling all the way to Paris and going to a Ripley's Believe It or Not Museum. It's a tourist trap that was created for domestic tourists.I don't understand why it's so heavily promoted while actual Korean cultural spots are neglected.
"Great tour experience with our guide Joe Park My family and I enjoyed our trip with guide Joe Park. We captured many beautiful sceneries along the way. Joe is very knowledgeable. He shared many tips and dining recommendations around Seoul with us. Overall, a great tour and would highly recommend this to visitors."
"A great day visiting Nami Island We used K-1 Private Tour, through Viator, and had an excellent day; Nami Island, Rail Bike & Garden of Morning Calm. The garden was in bloom; Rail Bike must be experienced; and we could have spent all day on Nami Island."

"Overhyped We joined a tour from Seoul to the Garden of morning calm, Nami island and Gimyujeong rail bike. Nami island was supposed to be the highlight of the tour but turned out the worst of the 3 places visited.  It is overhyped, with just average attractions and not really worth a visit unless you were a fan of “Winter Sonata”. There are not that many activities but lot of visitors. The gardens on Nami island pale in comparison to the beautiful Garden of morning calm."
"Nami Island is Love Nami Island is a picturesque and tranquil escape from the hustle and bustle of city life, located about an hour's drive from Seoul, South Korea. As a traveler, I highly recommend a visit to this small half-moon-shaped island, which is known for its stunning natural beauty and cultural attractions.One of the main highlights of Nami Island is its beautiful tree-lined paths, which are perfect for leisurely strolls or bike rides. As you explore the island, you'll find plenty of peaceful spots to relax and enjoy the scenery, from tranquil streams and gardens to scenic viewpoints overlooking the Han River.In addition to its natural beauty, Nami Island also offers plenty of cultural attractions for visitors. The island is home to a number of art galleries and museums, showcasing the works of local artists and preserving the island's cultural heritage. You can also experience traditional Korean culture through various cultural performances and workshops, such as traditional Korean dance or calligraphy.One of the most popular attractions on Nami Island is the famous ""Winter Sonata"" filming location, which has become a pilgrimage site for fans of the popular Korean drama series. Visitors can take a stroll down the famous tree-lined path where the show's romantic scenes were filmed, and even snap a few photos at the iconic statue of the show's stars.Overall, Nami Island is a must-visit destination for any traveler seeking a peaceful and scenic escape from the city. Whether you're interested in nature, culture, or simply looking for a quiet place to relax, this charming island has something for everyone.I'm Planning to complete the 5 colors of Nami so far I have 2 3 more to go.."
"Nice place to relax, but very crowded While Nami is famous for Winter Sonata, as someone who has never watched the drama, it was still beautiful and enjoyable. It is not somewhere with a lot of activities, just nicely manicured gardens and paths to wander, as well as some cafes and restaurants (but expect queues during mealtime).During spring there were lots of flowers and tourists. Many, many domestic and foreign tourists, so the zipline into the island was fully booked and there was traffic leading into the area near the ferry.Ferry is very frequent so not much of a queue.A nice place to chill, but not somewhere I'd be in a rush to go back to as there are other natural sites to see."
A must visit for first tiners This was my second trip here. What made the experience a bit difficult was the uncooperative weather. It was a bit hot so walking under the sun made it difficult.The scenery was still exhilarating but the heat sapped my energy.
Nami island tour One of our best trip.wonderful trip coz of the help of our VERY GOOD beautiful  Guide . I recommend Sofia Kim if you want to have great time in your future tour of South Korea.
Don't understand the hyper behind this island I don't understand the hype behind this. Wasn't really impressed. First & Last for me. Maybe it will be nicer during snowy season Nothing special Very poorly maintained island. Tourist trap. Nothing to see. Long drive with traffic from/to Seoul. Not so sure why people are excited about this place. All photos with beautiful color and seasons seems just fake !
"Beautiful Place to visit We did a day trip to Nami  Island. Middle of winter, it was cold, but worth it. i would love to see it in the spring when everything is blooming. Could spend hours wandering the island looking at whats there.There is also a zip line you can take to get onto the island which is a must do."
"Breathtaking nature views that differ with each season This is one of those places you can visit multiple times in the year and still feel like there's something new to discover. The ferry ride is nice and comfortable, providing you with warm air in the cold winter months especially when it's freezing cold wind chills outside. Place has become somewhat of a tourist destination due to the hugely popular korean drama setting so there are shops ranging from convenience stores to souvenir shops and even restaurants and cafes.Do note that during winter, some pathways will be frozen over with ice so please wear proper footwear to prevent slipping. There are also a few fire pits where you can enjoy toasting some marshmellows which can be bought from stores nearby. Recommend to spend half a day here to soak in the scenery and take a leisurely walk around the island on foot."
"Exciting 😊😄 I feel so much energized and exciting with the environment of the island. Efficient ferry and smooth journey. Self Guide walk,  trees, frozen lake, tiny animals like rabbit roaming around the place and facilities ."

"Beauty🍁 Famous place frequently visited by tourists from Seoul, nevertheless amazing atmosphere during autumn, rather felt like Korean dramas.Walked until the end of island & less crowd there for some photoshooting."
Beautiful in autumn The brilliant reds & gold leaves trees made Nami island so beautiful!!Made it a point to enjoy the colors & travel from  from 3rd week of Oct.
"Very pretty but commercialised tourist spot Quite a fun place to visit. There are storage lockers for your luggage if you have them with you.Entire place is pretty and cute. You take the ferry or the zip line in, then walk around the island, many groves of different trees - each grove is a single species of trees (ginkgo, walnut, birch, maple) so you get spectacular photographs. Lots of couples there taking photos, lots of tourists too.There are lots of wild peacocks, squirrels and bunnies, and the river flowing around the island makes it more beautiful somehow.Food on the island is not much more than at mainland, and the food taste good."
"Nami Island is in Gapyeong, not Chuncheon!!"
"If you take the train from Seoul to Chuncheon, you will not be close to Nami Island. It is actually near Gapyeong. We initially went to Chuncheon and only discovered afterwards that we should have gotten off at the Gapyeong station, which we passed through on the way to Chuncheon.I’m not sure why TripAdvisor lists Nami Island under Chuncheon, but it wasted an hour of our time."
"half day recommended a half day there should be more than enough to walk around the whole island.there are many photo spots and gift shop.there also seem to be some pottery workshop if you're interested in that.has about 5+ eateries there so no lack of food option Fun and beautiful place This place was a very fun place to sightsee and to even eat some excellent food. You can get here two ways, the ferry boat or by huge zipline, which was what I did, and that was probably the best part about it, though the zipline was pretty scary. Once you get there, it's full of green and little small details like tiny bridges and sculptures. There's also many different options of food there, so hunger is not an issue. I went in the summer so it was very humid and hot but I would like to visit again in the spring or definitely in the winter when it snows. Overall, I would definitely say it's worth your time and should check it out."
Great place to visit in the Spring Nami Island is an island in the middle of the North Han River about an hour from Seoul by train or intercity train.  it has lots of nice trails and very nice views especially pretty in the fall and spring. You can stay on the island resort.  it has an old fashioned vibe.
"Day out with friends It was a wonderful getaway from the hustle and bustle of Seoul. Mesmerising nature that any photo at any spot would look wonderful. We walked around and sat in different spots. Got some ice cream and snacks. There were some interesting looking sculptures too and saw few squirrels and rabbits and peacocks too. There are activities such as cycling and water sports. It is a nice place for couples, friends, families to spend the day. I would like to visit it in different seasons I bet it would be marvellous."
"Good to do for day trip, however not necessary Interesting place to head to for a day trip out of Seoul city . Nice spots to take photos . Food was frankly , underwhelming. Had sausages / green tea restaurant / steamed red bean bun/ snowman pancake.Could finish walking round the island in 2 hours ."
"Scam Nami  blows big time. Overcrowded, not pretty, and the perfect example that marketing is more important than substance."

"Enchanting island - Nami Nami is and independent island and It brings us to another world on this island. Beautiful in the fall, the vibrant colours from the well landscaped trees, plants flora and fauna. Beautiful in any angles makes beautiful picture postcards.Many came here for the  Kdrama setting which we have no clue or knew about until we saw a worn out poster that many were taking photos with/of.We're just happy to be strolling this island for a day and enjoying snacks and local food, cafes. Good place to (must) visit with friends or with family.Direct bus from Myeongdong or longer route by train. Then short ferry trip."
"Overnight stay Arrived about 8pm. The island appears shut down and very quiet. Hotel van shuttle picked Imus up at the ferry terminal and appeared to know of our arrival. We may be the only people in the hotel and although we did manage to catch last call for a drink it looks like bed time here is 9PM. No sign of the crowds so talked about online, at least so far...."
"Beautiful in Autumn While the island has some pretty scenery, it is almost always packed to the point where it’s impossible to enjoy it. Have patience as there will be multitudes of individuals and groups posing for that perfect Instagram. So if going for scenery and photography I’d recommend a different place. I do think they’ve done a great job with the infrastructure to help mitigate the crowds. Strolling the island for casual leisure and family time is great, they have a lot there for children. I’d recommend grabbing food on the island. The Hotteok (sweet Korean pancake) is delicious. Zip-lining in is our favorite way to enter. Visiting the nearby Garden of Morning Calm, Petite France, and/or Gangchon Rail Cars would round the day out nicely. I love the sign they added for the Tulip Tree that fell during typhoon Lingling, very comical."
"A Very Popular Tourist Attraction Near Seoul We went on our own to Nami Island from our hotel in Myeongdong.There are different ways of going to Nami Island. One is to join a bus tour that departs early at Pagoda Park in the morning (8 am) and returns at 1 pm or to Do It Yourself (DIY).Here is a simple guide to go there:1. From Myeong-dong Station, take LINE 4 train heading to the direction of Chungmuro Station to get to Dongdaemun History & Culture Park Station.(Train ticket one way is Won 2,550)2. When arriving at Dongdaemun History & Culture Park Station, change to LINE 2 and take the train heading towards Sindang Station to get to Wangsimni Station.3.When arriving at Wangsimni Station, change to JUNGANG LINE and take the train heading towards Cheong-nyangni to get to Mangu Station.4.When arriving at Mangu Station, change to KYEONGCHUN LINE and take the train heading towards Galmae Station to get to Gapyeong Station, which is our destination.This train journey from Myeongdong to Gapyeong will cost you KRW2550 (Cash) one way.It is one of the most visited places in South Korea because of a Korean Drama shot in the island I love Nami for its beautiful trees with autumn yellow leaves."
"Before and after I came to the island, I had re-watched the series ""Winter Sonata"". For that, Nami island had never disappointed my expectation. Very peaceful, very beautiful! Pure fresh air from this island will stay in my mind for long."
"For nature and k-drama lovers Though quite a ride from Seoul, it is a must out-of-town trip.Hire a van with driver to make the commute comfortable. Drop by Petit France first since it is on the way.Gets too crowded especially around lunch time. Better eat lunch back at the coast and not here in the island.Love the trees and the view of the lake. Lots of photo opportunities."
"Nami adventure When visiting south Korea you should consider Nami island on your bucket list. The place is wonderful especially who likes nature. There's also a lot of activities in the island. Walking around the island is very relaxing and breathtaking , if your hungry they also have good restaurants around. And also the have rooms if u want to stay there for over night or for how many days."
Must go place if you really love nature!
"I was here a few years back for the autumn season which the fallen leaves were really beautiful and nice! So this time round I decided to drop by Nami Island during Spring and I really loved Nami even during Spring!Once you have landed at Nami Island from the ferry, you can really feel the spring showers and wind blowing across your face. You can just practically spend the bulk of your time enjoying a slow walk along the tall trees, or to look out for famous sights where Winter Sonata was filmed. But one of the things I like to do over at Nami is to actually head over to the central area where there is a Well like structure. They do sell Red Bean buns which was really tasty, so I recommend heading over to the center area and see if the buns captures your stomach!You can also rent bikes to cycle around Nami so that could also be another option when you are here. A thing to note is that you might need to take note of the ferry arrival and departure hours as during peak seasons where there are a lot of tourist, it might be challenging for you to get on your ferry. So if you are a time sensitive traveler you might want to factor this in!"
"Autumn is the best time to visit Visited Nami Island during autumn, the autumn foliage is amazing. There are several paths that lead to different trees being planted on the island. scrap any planned path you may have, just go with the flow. Cater more time for the visit to Nami island and do take note of sunset time. the island is boring after sunset."
"서울에서 꼭 가봐야 할 곳 남이섬은 제가 추천하는 매우 아름다운 곳입니다. 이곳에서 키 큰 나무 아래를 걸어가거나 강변을 따라 산책하여 고요함을 즐길 수 있습니다. 사랑스러운 눈사람의 존재와 벽난로의 설정은 섬에 따뜻함을 더합니다. 눈이 내리는 추운 겨울에 특히 좋습니다. 섬에는 공작새와 토끼 같은 야생 생물도 있습니다.아름다운 자연 외에도 작은 기차, 노래 박물관, 자전거, 장식, 상점 및 레스토랑 등 섬에 시설이 있습니다. 나는 꿀 겨자 소스로 나미 소시지를 맛 보았습니다. 가격은 3, 000 원이며 시도해 볼 가치가 있다고 생각합니다.지하철, 택시 및 페리를 타면 도심에서 섬에 도착하는 데 2 시간이 걸리지 만 여전히 장소를 추천합니다. 또한 가을과 같은 다른 계절에 아름다운 경치를 즐기기 위해 다시 오는 데 관심이 있습니다."

"This Place always make me missed it its for your honeymoon or your prewed fotography or have a quality time with your family. They have so many scenery and facility, rent bike , electric bike, train ,  water sport on summer like flying fish, banana boat and other 많은 사람들이 있지만 시설은 압도되지 않았습니다 우리는 Klook을 통해 예약 한 하루 투어의 두 번째 다리로 이것을 방문했습니다.남이섬을 방문한 사람들의 수는 전반적인 경험에서 약간 혼란 스러웠습니다. 그러나 인프라가 너무 까다로워지지 않도록 충분히 개발되었음을 인정합니다. 화장실은 섬 전체에서 쉽게 구할 수있었습니다.나는 페리의 격렬한 내부를 좋아했다. 냉동 조건을 감안할 때 많은 환영을받습니다.완벽한 겨울 연가 사진을 촬영하지 않으려면 추천합니다!"
"평화로운 로맨틱 아일랜드 여기서 적어도 2 시간을 소비하는 것이 가장 좋습니다. 부두에서 중앙까지 걸어가는 것을 즐길 수 있습니다. 스노우 존, 높은 트리 존, 리버 사이드 가든 등이 있습니다.이 섬은 계절마다 아름다운 전망을 가져야합니다."
"펀 아일랜드 볼거리와 볼거리가 많고 카페가 많은 재미있는 섬입니다. 작은 조각상, 얼음 조각, 얼음 조각에서 썰매를 내리는 눈 언덕이있었습니다. 도처에 화장실! ! 나를위한 주요 사건은 강변 보도이었다. 끝까지 아주 조용히!"
좋은 소풍 남이섬은 서울에서 3 시간 거리에 있으며 단체 투어에 참가했습니다. 일반적으로 단체 여행은 아침 진정의 정원에서 길을 따라 또 다른 매력으로 표시됩니다. 둘 다 좋은 매력이었습니다. 부두에 도착하면 남이섬으로가는 페리가 짧고 주파수가 좋습니다. 우리는 춥고 바람이 부는 날에 갔고 상황이 좋았을 때 여전히 방문을 즐겼습니다. 우리는 겨울 연가 (2002 한국 드라마)의 팬이었고 영화 촬영지의 위치를 알려주는 랜드 마크가있었습니다. 나무가 늘어선대로는 정말 좋았고 고요하고 자연적인 효과가 있습니다! 눈이 아직 나쁘다. . . 또는 그것은 꽤 장면 일 수 있습니다 :) 아름답지만 포장! 너무 많은 사람들.
1 초 동안 빈 사진을 찍을 것이라고 생각하지 마십시오. 일년 내내 특히 모든 잎 색깔을 가진 가을에도 그래도 가치가 있습니다.
"Super super cute This is a fun trip to do, especially with friends. If you do not feel like doing a tour to visit the island it is super easy to get to with public transportation. The island itself is very beautiful with lots of nature and well maintained grounds. The staff is nice and the food as mouthwatering. Honestly wish I could have spent more time here and is a must visit again."
Nice getaway form Seoul Place where korean soap opera winter sonata was filmed.It would be prettier during snow season.Crowds of tourists from all over the world come to the pilgrimage of korean soap opera location.
"Not much of a scenery if there is no snow Nami island is best visited if there is there is some colours of the leaves can be seen like spring, autumn but dont go during early winter (we went on 18 Dec) and all the leaves dropped, the colour is mostly brown. Thus there is not much too see in terms of nature and the island is quite small with just some structure or statue that reminded us of Winter Sonata."

남이섬 방문하기에 매혹적이고 목가적이며 재미있는 곳. 시골 분위기에서 고대 한국을 한 눈에 들어보고 멋진 현지 식사를 즐기십시오.
남이섬 한국인들은이 장소가 한국 드라마 겨울 연가에 등장하기 때문에 특별하다는 것을 알고 있습니다. 나는 실제로 여행하기 전에 드라마를 보았다. 아름다운 나무 선 도로가있는 독특하고 경치 좋은 지역입니다. 우리는 가을에 방문하여 주변 단풍에서 변화하는 색상을 즐길 수 있었기 때문에 매우 아름답습니다. 많은 사진 조작 영역이 있습니다. 하이킹이나 자전거 타기 많은 트레일. 어린 아이들을위한 재미있는 놀이기구. 즐길 수있는 상점과 레스토랑. 이 지역에는 1455 년에서 1468 년 사이에 통치했던 조선 왕조 세조의 통치 기간 동안 반란군에 대항하여 큰 승리를 거둔 나미 장군의 무덤이이 지역에 있다는 것을 아는 사람은 많지 않습니다. 남이섬에 도착하고 시간을 보내려면 하루의 좋은 시간이 걸릴 것입니다. 당일 치기 여행을 위해이 지역을 포함하는 여행 그룹에 가입하는 것이 가장 좋습니다.
아름다운!
방문 할 가치가있는 매혹적인 자연. 도시에서 기차로 1 시간 이상 소요됩니다. 공원을 따라 산책하는 것은 놀랍습니다.
"Winter Sonata The Place Where Love Begins 🥰 Nami Island was the highlight of the day. Originally we were a little bit apprehensive about visiting since Nami Island is extremely famous for being the filming location of the popular K-Drama, Winter Sonata. Regular readers will probably know that I’m not the biggest fan of busy attractions in Korea!This is place where love was found and made famous in the movie “Winter Sonata” series that made Korea such a wonderful place to visit around the world."
"Fantastic place Oh this place is fantastic, the trees so gorgeous and the air is so fresh. It's just a short boat ride on to the island, where you enjoy the scenery and its beauty. Also food and entertainment is available for kids and adults."
Romantic winter time at Nami island .
"My second time been to Nami Island after 7 years . I missed this place . Not to be missed out , a must visit !"
"Scenic and Romantic A scenic island in the middle of a river. About an hour's ride from Seoul, followed by a short ferry, or ""fly"" across if you want a bit of thrill. It was a cold day and the ice carvings were pulling in the crowd. I can imagine that the best season seeing this place would be deep autumn - we shall be back, one day."
"Nami Island What a magical place this is. It is winter when I was there but the snow has yet to fall. I could only imagine how beautiful and romantic it would be when its all white. So much to explore. Beautiful walks almost at every corner.The perfectly in line tree lanes is breathtaking, making any photos taken turned out perfect! Definitely a place to visit in South Korea."
Short review on Nami Island We liked this visit to Nami island very much. It took a 15 min ferry ride to the site. There are regular scheded trips. The ice sculptures are very nice. A photoshoot at the Winter Sonata film location is a must do.
MAGICAL LIKE A STORYBOOK IN FALL We went there right at its best moment. The yellow ginko leaves and red maple leaves turned into magical flowers. It feels like you went inside a story book. The weather is cold but pleasant and bearable. Nami Island is a place for all seasons. We already experienced the green trees during last summer. We will surely go back at spring to catch the cherry blossoms.

"아름다운 작은 섬 섬에서 3 시간 만 보냈고 섬의 많은 곳에서 사진을 찍을 수있었습니다. 보트는 많은 관광객을 데려 왔지만 많은 사람들이 단지 두 시간 동안 거기에있었습니다. 시도 할 많은 말렛 식당이있었습니다. 시간이 허락한다면 반나절을 쉽게 보낼 수 있습니다. 섬에는 타조, 토끼 공작도있었습니다."
"나쁘지 않은 것도 특별하지 않습니다 페리 또는 비행 여우를 사용하여 섬에가는 방법은 2 가지가 있습니다. 겨울이되자 후자를 선택합니다. 섬에 도착하는 데 약 5 분이 걸렸습니다.섬에는 영화 ""Winter Sonata""의 장면에서 나무 사이에서 눈에 띄는 사진을 찍을 수있는 곳이 많이 있습니다. 불행하게도 나무를 덮고있는 눈도없고 잎도 없었습니다. . . . 나뭇 가지와 나뭇 가지만 사용할 수 있으므로 영화에서 장면을 재현하려는 경우 눈이 내리는 지 확인하십시오.길을 따라 핫도그, 아이스크림 등을 판매하는 공급 업체가 있습니다. . . 오히려 비싸지 만 그들은 섬에서만 먹을 수있는 음식입니다.전반적으로 한국에 있다면 가자.하지만 두 번 할 것이 아닙니다."
"Beautiful, peaceful.. depends.."
"It was a beautiful place, instagram worth photos, when youre the only one there. The downside was that when its packed, everyone wanna get the worthit pic and you tend to get someone's head or hand or whatever in your photo. It is still a serene, breathtaking place when no one is around to mess up your pic tho. I saw a dog owner let his dog pee on a tree lol that kinda dampened my spirit to lay on the grass and take a pic. At the end of the day, its a wonderful place.. worth a visit."
"겨울철 겨울 썰매 타기 긴장을 풀고, 여기에서 시간을 보낸 후, 우리는 3 p에서 아침 진정의 정원 버스를 타러 갔다. 조명 축제를 놓치지 않도록 m."
"아름다운 개인 섬 네이티브 모란 잉꼬와 인기있는 데이트 장소로 알려진 월요일 아침에 처음 도착했을 때 혼잡하지 않았습니다. 겨울인데도 여전히 가을의 색을 볼 수 있습니다. 이른 아침이었던 것에 따라, 그것은 안개가 컸다. 그리고이 경치가 좋은 섬은 섭씨 0도에 가까운 고요한 고요함과 아름다움을 가지고있다.식당과 기념품 가게가 몇 군데 있지만 그렇지 않으면 아름다운 자연이 있습니다. 강 한가운데에있는 섬의 가장자리를 따라 걷는 것도 매우 진정합니다. 방문할만한 가치가 있습니다."
"재미있는 곳 일부 동물, 풍경 및 음식이있는 재미있는 곳. 사진을 찍을 좋은 곳이 없어서 사진을 찍지 않으면 모든 것을 빨리 끝낼 수 있기 때문에 할 일이 많지 않습니다. 군중이 사라질 때까지 기다려야합니다. 한국 원화를 나미 통화로 환전 할 수있는 '은행'도 있습니다."
초겨울에는 볼거리가 없습니다 다른 계절에 있거나 눈으로 덮인 경우 방문이 훨씬 좋습니다.12 월 중순에 방문했는데 실제로 볼 것이 많지 않습니다. 기계로 만든 약간의 눈으로 비참한 작은 경사가 있습니다. 방문객들은 눈 위에서 사진을 찍고 있습니다.화재 장소 (나무로 태워)는 방문객들이 따뜻하게 지낼 수 있도록 여러 곳에 설치되어 있습니다.섬 주변에서 자전거를 타는 것이 좋습니다. 키가 큰 나무를 순환하는 것이 좋습니다. 섬이 크지 않기 때문에 30 분 동안 4000 원이 소요되었다. 렌탈 센터가 페리 터미널 근처에 있으면 더 좋습니다.편안한 장소.

"반짝이는 전부가 금은 아닙니다 남이섬은 사계절의 장소로 묘사됩니다. 눈 덮힌 겨울, 벚꽃 봄, 녹색 여름, 빨간색 노란색 떨어지는 단풍 풍경. 그러나 12 월 초가 춥지 만 눈이 내리지 않는 12 월 초에는 모든 것을 볼 수없는 경우가 있습니다. 솜 브레장소 : 서울에서 코치로 약 90 분. 일단 거기에 도착하면 (스탠드 룸) 페리를 타고 섬으로가는 티켓을 구입하십시오. 다리가 파이프 라인에 있습니다 (가장 시위). 다른 쪽 부두에서 작은 섬 주위를 걷거나 (약 1 시간) 자전거를 빌릴 수 있습니다 (가족 용으로 탠덤을 이용할 수 있음), 미니 기차 (단거리 전용), 버기 기차 (20 분 정도) 한국어로만 이야기하는 섬).타조 펜, 기계로 만든 스노우 힐, 카페가있는 악기 박물관, 푸드 센터 (할랄 레스토랑 및 무슬림을위한 기도실 포함)가 있습니다.12 월 이전에 눈이 오는 것을 피하여 남이섬을 최대한 활용하십시오."

"숨막히는 고요한 섬 KKday에서 페리 터미널까지 예약 한 서울에서 코치를 타고 나미 섬으로가는 페리를 탔습니다. 페리는 지정된 시간에 도착했으며 약 5 분 정도 탑승 할 때 아무런 문제가 없었습니다.남이섬은 우뚝 솟은 나무의 흔적에서 멋진 경치를 감상 할 수있어 놀랍습니다. 한국 드라마 윈터 소나타에서 명성을 얻었으므로 촬영에 관심이 있다면이 섬으로 향하십시오.우리는 코치로 돌아 가야하기 전에 약 2 시간을 걸어 다녔지 만 섬의 절반 정도만 커버 할 수있었습니다. 가능하다면 더 오랫동안 거기에 머무르는 것이 좋으며, 여러 가지 식사 옵션이 있으므로 식사를 위해 정착하십시오. 여행하는 동안이 섬에 오셔서 환상적인 전망에 매료되는 것이 좋습니다!"
나미 나라 공화국 멋진 경치가 보이는 아름다운 섬. 깨끗하고 평화로운 곳. 많은 활동을 할 수 있습니다 (하늘 자전거 등).
"아름 다운 사람이 만든 섬 풍경은 숨을들이 마시고, 각 각도는 완벽한 사진입니다. 인기있는 K- 드라마가 겨울 풍경에 인기를 끌게 된 것은 놀라운 일이 아닙니다. 각 계절마다 다른 장면이 제공되며 색상은 매력적입니다.도보 또는 자전거로 쉽게 갈 수 있고 많은 식당과 카페에서 휴식을 취하거나 간식, culpa를 먹거나 가족이나 친구와 식사를 할 수 있습니다.가족과 애완 동물 친화적 인 섬. 최근에 독립을 달성 한 흥미로운 역사는 자체 통화로 1000 거주지의 마이크로 국가가되었습니다.방문하십시오. 명동과 인사동에서 직행 버스로 2 시간이 소요됩니다. 보트 타기 10 분 및 모험적인 지퍼 라인으로 9 분 만에! !"
여기를 방문 할 가치가있는 보기는 훌륭했다. 가이드는 우리에게 올바르게 설명했습니다. 과정은 쉬웠다. 우리 시대에 많은 사람들이 노력하지 않았기 때문일 수 있습니다. 전반적으로 재미 있고 놀라운 경험이었습니다. 물론 남이섬은 숨이 views 을듯합니다.
"Beautiful place with many corners for good photos You can reach the island via a ferry or in style through an A line zip! There were many good corners and opportunities for photo shoot. Kids will enjoy a mini train ride across the island for 5000 won and there is also a bus tour available if interested (7000won). There is accommodation on the island, a picture library and playgrounds. We enjoyed taking photos at a mock up wine tavern and a toilet (near the bike rental) which is designed to be strike by a meteorite.It was a shame that we went with a tour and had only 1h30min (including the ferry rides to and fro). We could easily have spent half a day there relaxing at the island."
남이섬 요즘 실제로이 장소를 여행하는 것이 가장 좋은시기는 아닙니다. . . 운 좋게도 우리는 여전히 일부 단풍이 떨어지는 것을 볼 수 있으며 실제로 바람이 불고 있습니다. 냉정한! ?
"Superb view! worth visiting very accurate waiting time for ferry, large space can stay indoor or outdoor. In Nami visitor able to rent strollers for 3000won for whole day which gives us much convenient. Very attraction and scenery were breath taking. It is very clean and comfortable to walk although there are many visitors. There's a muslim halal restaurant available with tasty menu's, they even have musollah and it is connected to picture library with indoor playground for kids while parent taking bites.Its a must go place when visiting SEOUL!"
"대부분 좋은, 빨리 가십시오!"
"한국에서의 놀라운 경험, 아마도 내가 가장 좋아하는 것. 불행히도 지금은 상점들로 가득 차 있지만 여전히 훌륭합니다. 남편은 약 10 년 전에는 사업으로 오염되지 않았으며 더 이상 저렴한 기념품과 음식 / 음료를 즐길 수 있다고 말했습니다. 나는 음식이 이민 지역 바깥의 레스토랑 가격의 두 배이기 때문에 나미를 먹는 것을 귀찮게하지 않을 것입니다.우리는 약 3 시간을 보냈습니다. 가장 중요한 부분은 첫 시간에 섬 주변에서 자전거를 타는 것이 었습니다. 우리는 보트의 첫 번째 사람들이자 자전거를 빌린 첫 번째 사람이었고 수백 명의 사람들없이 사진을 찍고 경험하는 것이 놀랍습니다. 우리는 12시에 떠났고 사람들로 가득 차 있었고 도로가 막혔습니다. 멋진 사진을 찍거나 자전거를 자유롭게 탈 수있었습니다.자전거는 품질이 좋지 않았습니다. 1 시간 동안 8, 000, 나쁘지는 않지만 자전거 좌석 중 하나가 고장 나서 직원이 변경하지 않으면 실망했습니다. 그들은 늙고 녹슬었다."
나미의 아름답고 매혹적인 전망 좋은 방문과 나는 다시 가고 싶어서 하루 종일 즐길 수있는보기를 원합니다. 그것은 단지 혼잡하지만 이것은 시간을 보낸 것에 대해 매우 매혹적인 장소입니다.
한국 소나무의 아름다운 차선 한국의 텔레 노벨 라에서 볼 수있는 아름다운 한국 소나무를 즐기십시오. 한국 텔레 소설을 좋아하지 않는다면 아침 고요 수목원을 추천합니다.

자연을 품다 유명한 나미를 기념하는 멋진 작은 섬. 섬에서 자연과 다른 요소를 완전히 즐기려면 하루를 보내십시오.
절대적으로 매혹적인 나는 최근 몇 년간 매년 네임 아일랜드를 방문합니다. 보통 10 월 말입니다. / 11 월 초. 올해 서울의 여름은 매우 길었고 비가 거의 없었으므로 서울 숲을 포함한 도시 지역의 은행 나무는 노랗게 변하지 않았습니다. 제가 남이섬을 발견했을 때 여전히 10 월 말에 노란 은행 나무가있었습니다. (보통 은행잎이 떨어졌을 것입니다.) 나는 10 일 동안 3 번 가면서 단풍의 색이 변하는 것을 보았습니다. 다행히도 다람쥐와 붉은 다람쥐에 대한 좋은 사진을 얻었습니다. 나는 수줍음이 많았 기 때문에 과거에 나미에서 다람쥐를 보지 못했습니다.
아름다운 섬!
월요일에 갔는데 여전히 혼잡합니다. 가을 분위기는 시원하고 상쾌한 공기와 화려한 단풍으로 아주 좋습니다. 서울 중심에서 지하철로가는 것은 3 번 노선을 갈아 타야하기 때문에 번거롭고 혼란 스러울 수 있습니다. 셔틀 버스로 가기가 더 쉬울 것입니다.서울에 하루가 더 있다면 방문하기 좋은 곳.
"winter sonata if you are fans of korean drama winter sonata, then this is the place you shouldnt miss...   nami island still remain nature and good for a day trip.."

So beautiful!!!
"I went with a tour bus in October, and it was so nice to see the color leaves and Fall season here!!! The different colors of the leaves really light up Nami Island :). I would highly recommend to come here in the Fall--October to early November. At Nami Island, you can eat and buy souvenirs. There are some snack shops, as well as restaurants on the island. You can also rent a bike for 8,000 won for 1 hour. I did the bike rental, and it was great to ride the bike around Nami Island. You can also see many different statues, and the famous Korea drama statue---Winter Sonata. Many fans from around the world come to Nami Island to see the Winter Sonata statue. It's smaller in person, but it's nice to see if you are a fan of the drama. Overall, Nami Island is such a gorgeous set it with tall trees on the sides of the path. I love it, and sure would visit again in the future :)."
"Lovely but very touristy Nami island is a must visit place when you’re in Seoul, at least once. Having said that, Nami is so packed with tourists even on weekdays. We went strolling and love seeing the autumn colors."
Don't  Miss To Visit A fun place to visit for families and solo traveler. A lot of beautiful views. Prepare  your cameras for the wonderful  moments.
"쁘띠 프랑스, 남이섬, 간촌 레일 바이크-대한민국 나는 지난 10 월 한국 남이섬에있었습니다. 나는 아주 좋은 곳이었습니다. 전략적인 사진 촬영 장소와 나는 그들이 자신의 사진을 되돌아 보았을 때 그곳에 온 사람들이 매우 확신합니다. 가을 시즌이었고 잎은 화려합니다. 내가 전에 느끼고 싶어 지금은 지금 순간에 sometihing. 거기에 도착하기 위해, 나는 klook에서 패키지를 샀다. 패키지에는 왕복 운송, Petite France, Nami Island 및 Gangchon Rail Bike의 입장료가 포함되어 있습니다. 여기서 사진을 공유하겠습니다. 저렴한 가격입니다. 패키지 가격은 RM 235에 불과합니다. . . . ."

한국 최고의 단풍 남이섬 또는 남이섬은 서울 수도 외곽의 아름다운 단풍으로 유명한 관광지 중 하나입니다. 페리를 타거나 우편선을 통해 나미 섬으로가는 재미있는 방법을 선택해야합니다. 섬을 여행하는 것은 도보로 편안한 신발을 착용하십시오. 그림 같은 휴양지이므로 많은 관광객들이 사진을 찍을 것을 기대하십시오.
"남이섬 아름다운 가을 경치-가을 연가 드라마 겨울 연가 이후로 항상 남이섬에서 아름다운 경치를보고 싶었습니다. 실제로, 화려한 나무가있는 매우 아름다운 가을 경치입니다. 사진 촬영하기 좋은 곳.호텔에서 현지 투어를 예약했습니다. 지역 투어는 호텔에서 당신을 선택하거나 돌아올 것입니다."
놀랄 만한 많은 놀라운 화려한 단풍으로 남이섬에서 돌아 왔습니다. 나미에서 가을의 절정이라고 생각합니까 ??
모든 연령대에 탁월합니다!
"서울의 혼잡에서 온 것을 환영합니다! 유쾌한 산책로, 쾌적한 전망. 시각적으로 관심이 많은 항목. 가을의 색채가 나타나기 시작하여 나무는 다양한 색으로 채워졌습니다. 페리는 본토에서 당신을 데려가 몇 분 밖에 걸리지 않습니다. 이 섬에 호텔이 있지만 1 ~ 2 박 이상 숙박하는 것을 상상할 수 없습니다. 낮이나 오후를 보내는 가장 좋은 방법입니다."
과대 광고-1/2 남이섬에 대한 많은 리뷰가 있었기 때문에 정말 궁금했습니다. 약속이 취소되어 매우 일찍 나미에 가기로 결정했기 때문에 다른 사람들이 밀링하지 않고 사진을 찍을 수있었습니다. 섬 / 페리 / 입구 게이트는 오전 8시 전에 열립니다. 입장료에는 왕복 보트 타기가 포함됩니다. 가평역에서 출발하는 트랜스 포는 버스 나 택시를 통해 갈 수 있습니다. 택시 요금은 약 5000 원이므로 특히 3 명과 함께 여행하는 경우이 거래는 나쁘지 않습니다.내 인상은 그것이 괜찮다는 것입니다. 어쩌면 과대 광고는 약 절반으로 줄어들어야합니다. 이것은 인스 타 그램 게임을 보장하는 사람이 만든 / 상업 정원 / 섬이기 때문에. 이 장소를 방문하는 가장 좋은 이유는 서울에서 교통이 매우 쉽고 저렴한 기차 요금이며 자세한 계획없이 섬을 쉽게 탐색 할 수 있기 때문입니다.
가을의 사랑 이야기 활동이 많은 아름다운 풍경. 다양한 색상과 완벽한 날씨로 가을에 가기에 가장 좋습니다. 봄과 겨울은 맨손으로 나무와 얼음 땅을 남기고 여름은 모든 푸른 나무와 너무 뜨겁습니다. 더 많은 옵션을 위해 페리를 타기 전에 외부 상점에서 식사하는 것이 좋습니다. 단 5 분만에 페리를 타십시오.
가을 사랑에 빠지는 매우 낭만적이며 장소의 분위기와 에너지를 느낍니다.이 섬은 영웅적인 장군의 이름을 따서 명명되었습니다. 하루 종일 걸어 다니면서 멋진 카페에서 휴식을 취할 수 있습니다.
예쁜 나무와 잘 지어진 곳이지만 관광객으로 가득합니다.
남이섬은 단풍을 볼 수있는 좋은 장소이며 기차 + 페리를 통해 쉽게 갈 수 있습니다. 그러나 관광객으로 가득 차 있으며 모든 소음 속에서 자연을 실제로 즐기기가 어렵습니다. 작은 상점과 식당도 있지만 서울에서 볼 수있는 일반적인 가격보다 더 비쌉니다.
"가족과 함께 서울에서 남이섬 자체 방문 남이섬은 참으로 아름다운 곳입니다. 우리는 이번 10 월에 그곳에 갔으며 가을, 나무에 붉은 색 잎이 꽂 히기 시작했고 놀라운 경치입니다. 우리의 작은 아이들은 달리고 놀면서 정말 좋은 시간을 보냈습니다. 그러나 두 가지 주요 단점이 있습니다. 하나는 서울과 거리가 멀다는 것입니다. 우리는 짧은 택시와 짧은 페리보다 가평까지 2 개의 기차를 따라 독립적으로 도착했습니다. 한 방향으로 2 시간 이상 걸렸습니다. 또 다른 옵션은 단순히 서울에서 여행하는 것이지만 훨씬 더 비쌉니다. 두 번째 문제는 장소가 매우 혼잡하다는 것입니다. 관광객과 방문객으로 가득합니다. 따라서 유럽 / 북아메리카에 거주하고 가을에 나무의 붉은 색을 보는 것이 평범하거나 붐비는 장소를 싫어하는 경우 나미를 쉽게 건너 뛸 수 있으며 다른 흥미로운 장소에서 하루를 보낼 수 있습니다 한국에서."
아름다운 섬이지만 touristy 남이섬은 매우 예쁘지 만 관광지입니다. 우리는 단풍을 보려고 거기에 있었고 많은 싸움과 토끼가 돌아 다니는 것을 보게되어 기뻤습니다. 혼자서 가면 매우 혼란 스럽기 때문에 일일 투어에 참여하는 것이 좋습니다. 식당 음식은 좋지 않으며 혼잡합니다. 자신의 음식을 포장하고 정원에서 소풍을하는 것이 좋습니다!

좋은 곳 우리는 너무 많은 방문자를 피하기 위해 아침 일찍 여기를 방문합니다. 우리는 여기서 평화 롭고 조용한 곳을 즐길 수 있습니다. 나무가 아름답습니다. 우리는 걷기와 자전거 타기로 긴장을 풀었습니다.
남이섬의 Rendevous 남이섬은 꼭보아야 할 곳입니다. 섬 주변의 자전거와 같은 것들을 탐험하고 재미있는 것들이 많이 있습니다. 가을과 봄 시즌에는 다시 돌아가는 것이 마음에 들지 않습니다.
Good place to stop by It was good place to hang around with friendsSo many beautiful trees Are there and good photo spots tooWell maintained and clean! Recommend to visit early in the morning there are so many ppl 가족에게 딱 일주일 동안 꽤 좋은 곳. 주말에 확실하지 않습니다. 아이들을위한 많은 활동. 화창한 날에 좋은 곳.
"남이섬 우리는이 섬을 방문하기 위해 서울에서 당일 치기 여행을했습니다.서울의 용산역에서 1 시간이 채 걸리지 않은 게이 평까지 ITX 열차를 탔습니다. 피크가 아닌 시간대에도 티켓이 빨리 팔리는 것처럼 보임에 따라 계획을 세울 가치가 있습니다.Gaypeong 역에서 우리 중의 3 명이 있었던 것에 따라 우리는 택시를 움켜 쥐었다 그것은 버스보다 빠르고 쌌다. zip 라인 (가족 코스) zip 라인 (어드벤처 코스 또는 페리)으로가는 두 가지 옵션이 있습니다. zip 라인 어드벤처 코스는 가파른 달리기이지만 다른 섬으로 이동하면 나미 섬으로가는 페리를 이용할 수 있습니다. zip 라인 가족 코스는 더 느리고 인기가 높으며, 2 시간의 대기 시간이 있었으므로 우리는 약 5 분 또는 10 분이 걸리는 페리를 탔습니다.이 섬은 산책하기에 아름답고 다양한 풍경, 호수 전망, 정원, 숲, 동상, 폭포 및 분수, 상점, 예술 및 공예품, 바, 레스토랑 및 문화적 장소를 즐길 수 있습니다.우리는 가을에 거기에 있었기 때문에 멋진 색상 중 일부를 보았습니다. 이것은 서울에서 당일 치기 여행으로, ITX에서 쉽게 관리 할 수 있으며 대도시의 번잡함에서 벗어나는 멋진 휴식이었습니다. 시골과이 놀라운 공원의 일부를 반드시보아야합니다."
남이섬 섬 자체는 매우 멋졌다! 나무와 자연으로 둘러싸여 있습니다 (많은 방문객 제외). 우리는 자전거를 타고 많은 사진을 찍었습니다. 공기는 좋았고 통로는 자전거와 자동차가 여행하기에 충분히 넓었습니다.
멋진 매력 대단한 매력입니다. 우리는 호수를 건너기 위해 보트로 가야합니다. 섬은 아름답고 평화로운 공원이며 문화적으로 멋진 거리로 개발되었습니다. 조용하고 조용한 장소입니다. 한국에서 봐야한다 한국의 행복한 곳 나는이 장소에 두 번 있었지만 그것을 극복 할 수 없습니다. 이곳에는 평화로운 느낌이 드는 것이 있습니다. 잎이어야합니다. . . . 계절에 따라 변화합니다.
"Beautiful in Spring We went during end of April, it was super cold in the morning. We took around 2 hours to cover the whole place. Nothing much actually, it just nice to take a break from the city as we went to Seoul. Everywhere is scenic so everyone pretty much took pictures at every corner with the beautiful flowers blooming. We ate lunch at Asian Family Restaurant Dongmun as it was the only halal restaurant. the food and portion size was pretty good also."
"죄악이지만 ... 투어 녀석 가야 할 아름다운 곳, 비가오고 있어도가는 곳, 페리는 5 분 정도 소요됩니다."

가을의 아름다운 나는 이곳을 영원히 돌아 다닐 수 있었다. 가을은 당신 주위에 따뜻한 색의 단풍이있는 완벽한 계절입니다.
평화 롭지 만 외치는 것은 없습니다 우리가 초여름에 방문했기 때문에 Perhapa는 봄이나 가을처럼 예쁘지 않았습니다. 그것은 일반적으로 평화 롭고 편안했지만 특별히 소리를지를 가치가 없었습니다. 한 번이면 충분합니다.
리빙 윈터 소나타 교통편과 가이드를 제공하는 서울 시티 투어와 함께 일일 투어를 예약했습니다. 반나절 산책과 섬 탐험에 보냈다.
매우 편안하고 편안한 우리 팀과 나는 행복한 아침을 보냈습니다. 사진 촬영을위한 많은 장면. 우리는 자전거를 빌렸다. 10 월에이 섬을 방문하여 노란 잎을 보는 것이 좋습니다.서울에서 시도해야합니다.
"매우 평화 롭고 편안한 장소 하루 여행으로 4 시간 동안 갔다. 그것은 충분히 길지 않았다. 하루 종일 보낼 수 있다면. 그들이 제공하는 좋은 점은 섬 주위를 순항하기 위해 세그웨이 유형의 물건을 임대 할 수 있다는 것입니다. 그들은 놀랍고 너무 재미있었습니다. 이 경험의 유일한 단점은 휴가로 인해 많은 사람들이 있다는 것입니다 서울에서 당일 치기 좋은 곳 나미 섬은 서울 시내 외곽으로의 하루 여행을 찾고 있다면 쇼핑 시내에서 휴식을 취하기에 좋은 선택입니다. 비록 우리가 최고의 타이밍 (이슬비가 내리고 여름과 가을 사이)에 방문하지 않았지만 우리는 여전히 섬 주위를 산책하는 것을 즐겼습니다. 유아가 견인을하면서 (읽기 : 느린 속도), 우리는 스윙 카페에서 시간을 보내는 것을 포함하여 3 시간 안에 abt에서 도보로 섬을 덮을 수있었습니다 (방파제에서 도보 3 분). 커피와 샌드위치를 즐기기에 좋은 아늑한 장소. 놀랍게도이 카페의 가격은 매우 합리적입니다. 나는 봄이나 가을과 같은 성수기에는 섬이 훨씬 더 아름답다고 생각하지만 비수기에도 여전히 아름답습니다. 군중이 오후에 최고조에 달하는 것처럼 아침에 방문 할 것을 제안하십시오."
관광하기 가장 좋은 곳 장소는 아름답고 깨끗했습니다. 친구와 가족과 함께 가기에 좋은 곳이었습니다. 할랄 식당도 많았습니다.
"남이섬 한국의 유명한 Telenovela의 ""겨울 연가""촬영지입니다. 우리는 페리로 10 분 미만 만 여행한다고 생각합니다. 섬은 그렇게 크지 않으므로 2 ~ 3 시간 안에 덮을 수 있습니다. 잘 보호되고 유지 관리되는 지역입니다. 우리는 온통 사진을 찍는 것을 즐겼습니다. 우리는 여름에 왔으며 혼잡합니다. 놓치지 마세요!"
아름다운 우리가 나미를 방문했을 때 비가오고있었습니다. 아직도 방문은 아름다웠다. 장마철에 방문 할 때는 방수 처리가되어 있으면 비옷과 운동화를 준비하십시오.
매우 관광지이지만 방문할만한 가치가 있습니다.
이 장소는 사람들로 가득했지만 여전히 방문할만한 가치가 있습니다. 섬은 매우 작고 반나절이면 섬 전체를 탐험하기에 충분합니다. 섬에는 많은 (가장 비싼) 포장 마차가 있지만 사진을 찍고 싶다면 좋은 위치입니다.페리가 섬으로가는 대신 우편 노선을 이용할 수있는 옵션도 있지만 방문 할 때 너무 추웠습니다.

"그럼에도 불구하고 방문할만한 가치가있는 매우 Touristy Name Island를 방문해야 할 이유는 두 가지가 있습니다. 하나는 당신이 Winter Sonata 팬이 아니라고 들었고, 두 개는 하드 코어 Winter Sonata 팬이라는 것입니다. . .윈터 쏘나타가 세계 무대에서 한류 드라마를 불러 일으키는 ""한류""를 담당 한 이래로 Name Island는 관광에 의해 변화되었습니다. 섬은 꽤 작지만 이곳 사람들을 매료시키는 것은 수많은 사진 촬영 기회가있는 아름다운 풍경입니다.섬에 들어가기 전에, 2006 년에 Name Island가 자치국으로 선포 된 후 Name Island가 실제로 미시 화 국가임을 알 수 있습니다. 그것은 심지어 자체 통화를 가지고 있지만 한국 원화는 널리 받아 들여지고 있습니다."
"DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME OR YOUR DAY This island must truly be rated mostly by either Koreans or Asians that haven't traveled much of the world. As islands and day trips go, it is below par and barely mediocre. I don't understand how there are so many good reviews. I think I would take the Bronx Zoo over Nami Island Waste of time and money There is nothing to see or do on the island. It is a complete waste of time and money. It takes about 10 minutes to walk the entire island. The shops are all tourist traps with nothing of interest. I can't imagine how it got such good ratings on trip advisor. I wouldn't even give it 1 circle."
"DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME far away from your imagination and far far away from those romantic pics !! the main boulevard  always crowded with tourists so its impossible take fancy  pics and it looks not so broad as on post .如果你在韓國觀光行程覺得太無聊或真的時間太多那我覺得可以把這個景點排進去.. 否則完全不建議浪費時間來這裡..到處都是觀光客..整個就是人工造景的感覺有點瞎 한국 방문 나는 한국 오산 AB에서 여행을 갔다. 한국에 있다면 꼭해야 할 일입니다. 나는 하루 종일 걸었고, 많은 사진을 찍었습니다. 섬의 레스토랑, 박물관, 상점은 훌륭했습니다. 겨울이었고 조명이 훌륭했습니다. 사람들도 훌륭했습니다. 좋은 운동화를 착용하십시오."
One of the most beautiful places in all of KOREA!!!
"I was really amazed about Nami Island. I think everything is perfect here. Evn though, it was still summer when we get here, the leaves are starting to paint red and orange, signalling a new season is fast-approaching.Getting here is very easy with a travel agency. Ours we booked it through KKDay."
Wonderful place in an offshore island at Korea Fantastic place of visiting the natural side of the Korea. Taking the ferry and enjoy a wonderful island place! Feeling relax and a comfortable day.
"나는 겨울 소나타 때문에 거기에 있었다 이 섬에서 당일 치기 여행을 예약했는데 드라마 겨울 연가를 상기시키는 길을 여행했습니다. 투어 가이드는 Kdrama 때문에 많은 관광객들이 그 장소를 방문한다고 말했다. 섬일뿐입니다.일년 중 어느 계절 에나 아름답습니다. 우리는 모두 녹색 일 때 왔습니다. 많은 영화와 드라마가 여기에서 촬영 되었기 때문에 사람들이 저를 포함하여 그 자리를 보게되었습니다. 내 아들은 이곳 저곳을 돌아 다니는 동물들을 좋아했습니다. . . . 다람쥐, 공작, 모든 종류의 새, 관광객의 핸드폰을 한 번 이상 먹었 기 때문에 동봉 된 타조.나는 눈사람이 그 지역 주위에 전시되는 방식을 좋아했으며 전 세계의 언어로 섬을 생각하는 간판에있었습니다. 여기서 한두 시간을 보낼 수 있습니다. 따뜻했기 때문에 우리는 식당에 잠시 머물면서 피자, 파스타, 닭고기를 먹었습니다. 맛 있었지만 꽤 비쌌습니다.드라마 이외에도 동물들도 옛날에 한국인의 삶의 방식을 배우게됩니다. 그것이 바로 엔터테인먼트, 문화 및 환경입니다.한국에있는 동안 꼭보아야 할 곳."
"봄의 남이섬 남이섬은 자연의 아름다움과 고요함을 선보입니다. 섬이 기억에 남는 장면을 촬영 한 곳이기 때문에 K-Drama Winter Sonata의 팬들에게 인기가 있지만, (나 같은) 단 한 번의 에피소드도 본 적이없는 사람들을위한 방문의 가치가 있습니다!남이 섬을 처음 방문했을 때는 가장 더운 여름날이었습니다. 그래서 대부분의 잎이 말라 버렸고 황량했습니다. 그럼에도 불구하고, 공원은 아직도 당신의주의와 감사를 사로 잡을 수있는 위엄과 우아함의 공기를 뿜어 냈다.다행히도, 지난 봄에 내가 그 풍경을 방문했을 때 그 풍경은 활기가되었습니다. 겨울의 추위는 아직 사라지지 않았기 때문에, 공원 주변 산책을 편안하게 해주는 에어컨이 설치된 실내 정원 (싱가포르의 정원 전시와 유사)에서 방금 산책 한 것처럼 느껴졌습니다.잘만되면 나는 다음 번에 가을과 겨울에 섬을 방문 할 수있을 것입니다!"
"Nami Island, South Korea If you love the Winter Sonata, then you should consider this place a part of your South Korea travel list. The island is about 2 hrs away from the city center. The little ""town"" has their own currency called Naminara thus you have to exchange your Korean won upon arrival. In totality, the place is soo picturesque esp the lined up trees where during my visit, we saw around 3 couples having their prenup shoots. It is very much ideal to go during winter time where the ground would be totally snnow white. You would definitely need a day to go around the island. A day tour would also include few hours at Petite France. A real quaint place with lots of beautiful sceneries."

정말로 즐거운 시간을 보냈다.
나미 공원 정말 좋은 곳. . 많은 사진을 찍을 수 있습니다. . 당신을 따뜻하게하기 위해 커피를 마셔야합니다. . 그것을 사랑하니?
좋은 장소 방문하기 좋은 곳. 여름철에는 매우 뜨거워지는 경향이 있으므로 권장하지 마십시오. 아직도 매우 멋진 장소. 사진을 찍을 곳이 많습니다. NAMI와 같은 인스 타 그램입니다. 밴드 연주가있었습니다. 그리고 배가 고프면 휴식과 카페가 근처에 있습니다.
"아름다운 섬 나는이 섬을 아주 좋아한다. 아름다운 나무, 풍경이 있습니다. 누구나 겨울 연가의 팬이고 배 용준은 한 번이 장소를 방문해야합니다."
즐거운 하루 PLIKO PLIKO와의 춘천 여행. 특히 남이섬에서의 경험은 매우 즐겁고 멋진 자연의 아름다움을 목격했습니다. 아주 좋은 PLIKO 여행. 이 멋진 여행을 위해 Gina 씨와 Toni 씨에게 감사드립니다.
"도시에서 멀리 떨어진 섬 남이섬과 작은 프랑스로 데려다주는 여행의 한 부분으로 갔다. 도시에서 차로 길다. 당신이 자연을 보는 것을 즐긴다면, 당신은 긴장을 풀고 걸어 다닐 시간이 있습니다. 이것은 당신을위한 장소입니다. 여기 주변에서 쇼핑 할게별로 없습니다. 카페와 레스토랑을 이용할 수 있습니다. 이곳은 한국 연극 - 겨울 연가로 유명합니다. 투어 가이드가 질문하면 겨울 연가를 보았습니까? 드라마는 약 20 년 전의 일입니다. 그 드라마를 본다면, 당신의 나이를 추측 할 수 있습니다."
아름다운 나무 비가 올 때이 장소는 약간 진흙이 될 수 있습니다. 많은 키가 큰 나무들과 동물들이있었습니다. 공작과 토끼도 많이있었습니다. 여기에서 할 일이별로 없으며 그냥 돌아 다니며 사진을 찍을 수 있습니다. 놀이터가 있습니다.
"와우. Crapola 우리 투어 패키지의 일부였던 서 락산 국립 공원을 여행 한 후 다른 두 가족과 함께 그곳에갔습니다. 얼마나 시간 낭비입니까? 자신을 약간의 악화와 돈을 절약하고이 장소를 건너 뜁니다. 그것은 당신의 돈과 정신으로부터 당신을 분리하기 위해 창조 된 사람이 만든 섬입니다. 끔찍하고 값 비싼 음식을 먹지 않고 값 비싼 장신구를 사면 높은 가격에 구입할 수밖에 없습니다. 피곤한 타조와 토끼의 펜과 실제로 박물관이 아닌 노래 박물관이 있습니다. 당신은 페리를 타고 페리가 당신의 관광 버스로 돌아갈 때까지 기다리는 것을 제외하고는 아무 것도 할 수없는이 작은 혼잡 한 섬을 걸어 다닌다. 나는 투어 회사가 섬에 사람들을 채우기 위해 돈을 잘 지불 받았다고 내 집에 걸었습니다. 우리가 보았던 누구나는 당황하고 잃어버린 것처럼 보였던 외국인이었다. 이 장소를 건너 뜁니다. 나 한테 고마워 할거야, 약속 해."
서울에서 시간 초과 서울을 몇 시간 동안 즐기기에 좋은이 섬은 의미가 있지만 관광지이며 다른 곳은 거의 없습니다. 군중들로부터 멀리 걸어 가면 조용해진다. 돈을 위해 그것의 꽤 가치가 있었던 KKDay 여행의 일부로서 갔다.
"자전거 렌탈 다른 평론가들이 말했듯이, 남이섬은 매우 관광객입니다. 그러나 대부분의 사람들은 섬 중간에 주 노선을 유지합니다. 나는 자전거를 빌 렸고, lovely 한 시간을 섬의 가장자리 주위에 더 풍경의 그리고 평화로운 길을 탐험하도록했다. 당신이 앉아서 숙고 할 수있는 그늘진 곳에는 많은 좌석이 있습니다. 자전거 대여는 페리가 떨어지는 지점에서 주 나무가 늘어선 길을 따라 600 미터 왼쪽에 있습니다."
"관광을위한 장소 이곳은 긴장을 풀고 긴장을 풀 수있는 큰 공원과 같으며, 자전거 타기와 수상 스포츠를 제외하고는 여기에서 할 일이별로 없습니다. 불필요한 4 시간을 보내려면 2 시간이면 충분하다고 생각합니다. 많은 레스토랑도없고, 기념품은 너무 비싸서 구입할 수 없습니다. 걷는 길은 모래와 진흙으로 가득합니다. 우리가 특히 아이들을 위해 걷는 것에 지쳤을 때 경로를 따라 더 많은 벤치와 쓰레기통을 놓아야합니다. 우리 아이는 다리가 아프다고 불평했습니다. 너무 많은 방문자가 같은 길을 걷고 있기 때문에 자전거가 너무 비싸고 자전거가 부드러워지지 않기 때문에 자전거 대여는 문제가되지 않습니다. 우리는 걷는 동안 위험 할 수있는 많은 급행 자전거를주의해야합니다. 적절한 자전거 도로는 관광객을위한 환경을 개선하기 위해 만들어 지도록 권장됩니다."

"Tranquil and Scenic Unfortunately, it rained when I arrived at the island else I would have given it 5*. Nevertheless, Nami Island is still one of the most scenic places I have ever visited. The filming location for the famous Winter Sonata does not disappoint. The gardens are well maintained and it was also a joy to see all the wild animals (squirrels, rabbits) in a large natural environment, compared to some of the other gardens in Korea when they are cooped up in small cages :(We had hoped to zipline down to the island but the weather did not allow for it. Worth the entrance fee!"
"과대 평가 된 우리는 섬에 여행 버스를 가져 갔다. 그리고 여행 시간은 각 방법으로 약 2 시간이었다. 사진을 찍을 수있는 명소가있었습니다. 그것 이외에, 섬은 지루하다. 그러나, 우리 방문 날에, 그것은 많은 관광객으로 북적였다. 나는 그 섬을 방문하는 것만으로도 여행할만한 가치가 없다고 느꼈다."
"Beautiful Nami island in summer may not be as beautiful as in other season, but still worth to see. We were planning to spend just an hour there before heading to garden of morning calm, but ended up spending 3 hours and didn’t have time to go anywhere else as we went with a bus shuttle that left at 4.30.nami island is a very serene and beautiful place. there are some small museums or exhibitions there. we particularly liked the one that showed beautiful paintings of andersen fairytales.we found many people bringing their dogs there and we had fun looking at them. there were also a big peacock and a few ostriches.i could only imagine how beautiful this small island in spring or autumn. will definitely visit it again in other seasons if we could."
경치 좋은 산책 남이 섬에 들어가는 가장 좋은 방법은 Zipline을 경유하는 것입니다. 보기는 훌륭하고 타는 것 자체는 빠르지 만 편안하다.남이섬에서는 볼거리가 많습니다. 나는 당신의 참고를 위해 아래 섬지도를 포함시켰다.
"Peaceful, Romantic and Memorable island a 평화롭고, 낭만적이며 인상적인 장소입니다.년간 1500 만 명의 관광객이 방문합니다.무슬림들이 기도할수 있는 작은 기도방, 무솔라, MUSOLA 가 마련되 있습니다.Peaceful, Romantic and Memorable island and famous Korean drama - ""Winter Sonata"" shooting place. over 15 million tourists visit in a year."
"노부모 방문 (휠체어) 나는 Paul Chang의 한국 휠체어 투어를 찾았고, 노인 부모를 서울에 4 일간의 짧은 휴가를 보내려고 계획했다. 82 세인 아버지는 멀거나 빠르게 걸을 수없는 이동 문제가 있습니다.장 씨는 휠체어를 돌보는 일에 관해서 자신의 경험과 헌신을 보여주었습니다. 그는 우리 의견으로는 매우 전문적이었습니다.장씨와 그의 동료 인 데이비드 (David)와 함께, 부모님은 나미 섬의 아름다운 봄 날씨와 명소를 즐길 수있었습니다. 이동성 문제가있는 누군가에게 실행 가능하지 않았던 어떤 것.장씨 (한국 휠체어 여행)에 큰 감사를드립니다!"
장소는 ok 다. 그러나 관광객으로 넘쳤다.
조용한 곳을 찾을 수 없으므로 섬의 멋진 사진을 찍을 수는 없습니다. 우리가 아침 일찍 거기에 도착할 때에도 관광객들로 넘쳐났다.
남이섬의 봄 봄 시즌의 남이섬은 사쿠라 애호가들에게 꼭 필요한 곳입니다. 섬은 아름답고 핑크색 꽃으로 덮여 있으며 봄바람은 정말 책을위한 것입니다!
반드시 방문해야합니다.
"단체 관광을하는 경우, nami island - ganchon railway - morning calm combo의 정원을 즐기는 것이 가장 좋습니다. 그래서 peti 프랑스는 건너 뛰고 nami를 즐길 시간이 더 있습니다. Klook은 가장 저렴한 투어 제공 업체이며 잘 조직되었습니다. 시간을 최대화하기 위해, 나미까지 5 분 페리에서 내리신 후 유니세프 열차를 타고 nami 섬 끝까지 가신 후 다시 부두로 돌아가십시오. 메타 세쿼이아 나무 경로 근처에 이탈리아 레스토랑과 아시아 레스토랑이 있습니다. 페리 터미널에서 유명한 dak galbi를 먹을 수도 있습니다. 당신이 포케몬을 가면, 섬에는 미친듯한 찌름과 찌르다 정지가 있습니다."
"관광 나는 약 11am에 보통의 것보다 나중에 조금 갔다, tad는 혼잡했다. 그러나 아직도 그렇게 나쁘지 않았다. 내 친구가 약 2 시간 일찍 와서 그녀는 그것이 비어 있다고 말했다. 연락선 표 가격은 ok이었다, 줄의 abit를 얻었다. 그러나 너무나 wasnt 한. 나는 너무나 멀리 wasnt 한 가평 역에서 택시에 탔다. 그러나 나는 버스가있다라고 들었다. 내 친구는 또한 관광 패키지 일일 패스를 구입하여 모든 nearbg 관광 명소에 버스 승차권을 포함시킬 수 있다고 말하면서 그냥 관광 카운터로 향합니다. 슬프게도, 나는 그것을 시험해 보지 않았다.그들이 나의 수화물을 유지할 수 있었을 정도로 표찰 계산대 뒤에 그들은 화장실 근처에서 사물함을 가지고 있었다. 그들에게는 zipline 활동이 있습니다. 이것은 당신이 섬에 들어가기위한 방법입니다. 페리를 타기보다는 정말로 흥미로 웠습니다. 페리는 상대적으로 빈번하므로 그렇게 나쁘지 않습니다.섬은 아름다웠다. 정말 놀라운 일이었습니다. 너무 예쁘고 고요했습니다. 비록 페리 부두에서 군중이 있었지만, 일단 insidez는 모두 사진을 찍기 위해 센터로 몰려들 것이다. 그래서 옆 길 중의 1 개까지 걸어 라. 그러면 그것은 그렇게 나쁜 cox ppl가 긴 산보를 원하지 않는 경향이있다. 그것은이 섬의 유일한 목적이다. 풍경은 훌륭했다. 돈의 가치가 있습니다. 여기에 점심을 먹기를 원한다면 레스토랑이 꽤 있습니다. 섬에 머물고 싶다면 숙박 옵션이 있다고 생각합니다. 당신이 참여하기를 원한다면 약간의 수상 활동이 있습니다."

"섬 모험 남이섬에 대해 많이 들었습니다. 나는 서울 로텔 시티 호텔 명동에 머물렀다. 페리 터미널에 갈 수있는 지하철이 있다는 것을 알았습니다. 지하철로가는 것이 저렴합니다. 내가 가야 할 역은 가평, 녹색 선이다. 나는 산봉 (sanbong) 역에서 58 분 걸렸고 14 스탑에 250 원 밖에 안 들었다. 병경에서 페리 터미널까지 약 3, 800 원 인 택시를 이용했다. 남이섬 입장권은 왕복 13,000 원입니다. 섬, 꽃, 나무 및 멋진 산책로에서 볼 수있는 곳은 아름다운 풍경으로 섬을 둘러싸고 있습니다. 이 섬은 한국 연재로 인기를 얻었습니다 : 겨울 연가. 수많은 카페와 레스토랑이 있습니다."
혼잡 한 인간 4 월 중순에 혼잡 한 관광객들과 함께 왔습니다 ~주변 사람들이별로 없다면 하루 종일 방문하기에 좋은 곳입니다.멋진 꽃; 나무와 풍경?
"Nice, too crowded It's my 5th time visiting Nami but during this trip we didn't walk through the center route instead we walked along the path near the water. It's better because it's not crowded and the view is better too."
"Romantic island Nice view, clean and many spot for taking instagramble photos...But when it is raining, it is a little bit difficult to find a place for take a sit...W nee walk for a little bit long way for having the main spot 4 월 초순에는 그리 좋지 않습니다."
잎은 화려하지 않았습니다. 당신이 공원에서 조용히 걸어 가고 싶다면 그렇게하십시오.타조가있다.
"남이섬 - 판타지 섬 풍경이 주변에 잘 늘어선 나무, 호수 및 언덕으로 완벽하기 때문에 어느 계절이든 멋진 장소입니다. 약간의 touristy 그러나 한국의 동안이 이국적인 섬을 찾아 갈 시간의 값이있는."
"평화 롭고 좋은 장소 12 월 중순과 5 월 초에 두 번 방문했습니다. 남이섬까지 페리를 타고 가야하며 페리 섬은 항구를 10 ~ 20 분 간격으로 출발합니다. 장소는 정말로 평화로 웠고 걷고, 아름다운 풍경을 즐기고, 간단한 식사 / 음료를 즐길 수있는 좋은 장소입니다. 아이들을 놀 수있는 놀이터가 있습니다. 섬을 여행하기 위해 도보로 걸어가거나 자전거를 빌려주거나 기차를 탈 수 있습니다. 섬 주변에 여러 개의 레스토랑과 카페가 있으며 음식 가격은 서울의 다른 레스토랑과 같습니다. 정말 멋진 핫떡을 판매하는 곳이있어서 체크 아웃하고 사용해보십시오! 나는 그것이 1이라고 생각한다. 5 - 2 시간은 섬을 탐험하기에 충분합니다. 소풍이 있거나 정말로 긴 산책을 떠나기 만하면 않는 한.5 월에 갔을 때 꽃이 피고 나무가 정말 아름답습니다. 반면에 12 월에는 너무 추웠을 때 많은 나무들이 불모의 땅이었습니다."
"재미있는 탐험하기 섬은 때때로 붐비지만, 여전히 방문 할만한 가치가 있습니다. 많은 사람들이 당신과 함께 사진에 잡힐 것이기 때문에 완벽한 그림을 기다려야 할 수도 있습니다. 장소는 lovely했고, 당신이 탐구 할 수있는 다른 지역이있다. 나는 겨울 동안이 장소를 몇 년 전에 방문했다. 그리고 그것은 단지 마술 적이었다. 올해 봄에 다시 방문했는데 여전히 신비합니다. 내 생각 엔 일년 내내 마법 같은 것 같아."
Amusement park. Good to visit when it's warm.
"The unusual park that foreign tourists' preference is much bigger than locals'.Even if this is not one of top places to go, locals love it anyway.Great place for 1~2 day trip.- Since this is a private property, it's well-maintained.- I think the admission fee(13,000 won) is affordable for the satisfaction.- From Seoul, taking a shuttle bus at Insadong/Myeongdong/Namdaemun or taking a taxi at Gapyeong Station is recommended. The distance from Gapyeong Station to Gapyeongnaru Ferry Terminal is almost half an hour to walk.- There is the street of dakgalbi(spicy fried chicken ribs) before the ferry terminal. Places to have lunch. There are restaurants and snacks on the island, too.- Good to connect a visit with other places in Gapyeong-gun. There's a city tour bus as well.- The best export of Gapyeong-gun is a pine nut. Try it if you have a chance.- There are pensions on the island. Find places for families who enjoy the island overnight.- Comparing to the size and visitors, there were quite few stewards and help centers."
"하루를 보내는 아름다운 장소 아름 다운 경로, 정원, 동상, cafs, 아름 다운 나무의 골목, 앉아 조용한 장소. 이것은 한국에 처음 방문한 것이고, 지역 가정이 아이들과 함께이 섬을 즐기는 것을 보는 것을 좋아했습니다. 페리 타기는 빠르고 잘 조직되어 있습니다."

"아름다운 섬 이것은 겨울 연가 영화로 유명한 작은 섬입니다.나는 영화에 대해 알고 한국 방문의 섬을 방문 할 기회가 있습니다.보고, 강둑을 따라 걷는 멋진 공원. 아름다운 사진을 찍을 수있는 좋은 장소 아무것도 몇 년 전에 나미 섬에 가봤습니다. 여기 두 번째. 장소는별로 변하지 않았습니다. 우리는 봄에 평온한 아침의 정원을 선호합니다. 이 곳이 겨울에 더 예쁘다고 믿습니다."
"사계절의 스펙타클 서울에서 택시로 남이섬까지 1 시간 30 분이 소요되었습니다. 내 딸들은 섬에 도착하기 위해 1 시간 30 분 동안 지퍼 라인을 기다리고 그것을 대단히 즐겼다 고 주장했다. 나는 페리를 탔다. 나는 그 섬을 좋아했다. 나는 새들의 소리를 좋아했다. 나는 해변 옆에서 눈 감고 자연의 소리를 들었다. 매우 긴장을 풀고, 매우 진정. 나는 섬을 걸어 다녔다. 나는 멋진 사진을 찍었다. 이탈리아의 레스토랑에서 점심을 먹고 기념품을 사 먹었습니다. 사람들은 재미있는 자전거를 타고있었습니다. 가을에 다시이 섬을 방문하기를 바랍니다."
"변경 사항 대응 나는이 관광 명소를 여러 번 방문했다. 이 변화가 사회의 변화하는 변화를 어떻게 극복했는지 감탄했습니다. Tv show Winter Sonata가 대중화시킨 것은 자랑스러운 한류 열풍을 시작한 것입니다. 관광객뿐 아니라 지역 주민들도 자주 방문하며 많은 활동을 할 수 있습니다. 그리고 당신은 여기에서 하루 종일 보내고 있습니다. 섬에 접근하기 위해 페리를 타고 가야하지만 실제로는 그렇게하는 번거 로움이 아닙니다. 추천. 그건 그렇고, 그것이 역사라는 것을 알게되면 좋은 반주가 될 것입니다. 내가 올리려는 사진들."
동화 같은 기교 ..
"남이섬은 30 년 동안 살아 왔던 곳 중 가장 아름다운 곳 중 하나입니다.그것은 거대한 빛과 큰 나무 밑에서 그림처럼 아름다운 산책로입니다. 서라운드 경관, 그 의심 할 여지없이 볼만한 광경을 비추는 경치 좋은 수변입니다.소비 될 많은 맛있는 식당과 간식이 있습니다.고용 될 수있는 자전거와 보트.날 믿어."
4 월 상순에는 특별하지 않습니다.
4 월 초에 서울을 여행하는 동안 그만한 가치가있는 여행은 너무나 즐겁습니다. 특히 겨울 연가 팬이 아닌 경우. 우리는 떠나지 않기로 결정했을 정도로 너무나 멀지 않은 봄의 정말로 첫 주에 도착하지 않고 있었던 아침의 고요한 정원에 가고 싶었다.
"To see then place in Korean Drama Get to know Nami Islands is because of a Korean Drama name “Winter Sonata”. but when visit, get to know that there is more in Nami Islands. Nami Island has a very nice walking riverside if you need a silent moment. a big field accompany with a line of trees make you like it much!another thing i would like to tell, there is a Unicef office in Nami Island. please pay a visit if you go to Nami Island!you can also rent a bike to ride around the islands. i do not do so because i would like to feel the island by walk."
4 월 중순 방문 4 월 중순이 가장 좋은 시간입니다. 4 월 중순 이전에 거기에 가면 불모의 나무가되며 모든 것이 갈색입니다. 나미에는 많은 한국 영화가 촬영되었습니다. 여행 할 가치가있어. 하지만 네가 4 월 중순에 꽃을 좋아한다면.
특히 아이들이있는 경우 하루 종일 반을 보내고 싶은 곳.
"연락선에 뛰어 다니고, 2,3 시간 동안 걸어 다니는 전설상의 장소. 다람쥐, 타조, 새와 칩몬이 많이 있습니다. 많은 카페와 음식 장소. 여름에 위대한 waterpark. 올챙이들로 가득 찬 연못. 아이들을 즐겁게하기 위해 놀이터. 용감한을위한 공원에 우편 선. 44000 원은 입장 할 것입니다. 입장료는 페리 등 어른들을위한 13000입니다. 10 페리 타고 섬에 도착합니다. 페리가 하루 종일 왕래."

휴가입니다.
나는 아내와 함께 남이섬을 여행했다. 장소는 낭만적이었다. 우리가 한국에있는 것 같아요.
촬영 장소 겨울 소나타의 일부였던 것 같은 느낌. 아직 꽃이 피지 않은 곳이긴하지만 자연의 아름다움을 볼 수 있습니다.
완벽한 시간을 가진 한숨을위한 좋은 장소 자연과 피크닉을 좋아하는 사람들에게는 아마도 음식의 장소 일 것입니다. 그러나 이곳은 방문하기에 완벽한 시간이 필요했습니다. 나는 3 월 말에 그곳으로 갔다. 그리고 그 장소는 죽었다. 장소도 꽃도 녹색이 아닙니다. 나는 4 월 중순 또는 4 월 말에 서울을 방문하는 것이 사쿠라 나무가 피는 곳에서 가장 좋다고 생각한다.
서울 검색 ..
"나미 아일랜드 여행에 완벽한 날씨를 지금 사랑합니다. 장소는 사진을위한 많은 지점과 더불어, 굉장하다, 모든 완전한 배경. 그것은 봄의 시작일지도 모르지만 슬프게도 많은 벚꽃이 아직 피지 않습니다. 그것은 더 완벽했을 텐데 아직도, 장소는 장관이다. 나는 섬에 선물 가게를 찾는 것을 기억하지 않는다. . 섬은 어린이들에게 친절합니다. 친구들이 사진을 찍는 동안 바쁜 시간을 보내고 즐기는 놀이터가 있습니까? 나는 그 풍경, 자연을 아주 좋아합니다."
4 월 초 너무 일찍 나무에 아무 잎도 없다 그래서 모두는 조금 황량하게 보였다. 산책하는 즐거운 산책로가 많지만 많은 관광객들도 있습니다. 맛있는 스낵과 1 시간 또는 2 시간 동안 바쁘게 지낼 수있는 것들.
숨가쁜 아름다운 가을!
"우리는 가을 동안 남이 섬에 갔다. 그리고 그것은 정말로 아름다웠다. 연락선 타기는 ok이었다. 그러나 그것은 정말로 꾸려졌다. 나무의 색깔은 너무 아름답고 풍부했고, 공기는 차갑고 선명하고 상쾌했습니다. 방문객이 너무 많기 때문에 이곳을 더 잘 관리해야합니다."
그만한 가치가있는 것은 아닙니다 !!
"사람들로 가득한 잼.효율적인 페리.사방에 사진 폭격기가있는 아름다운 공원.우리가 그들에게 빚을지고있는 것처럼, 일하는 직원들은 사심없고 지루해 보입니다.그것은 아름다웠지 만 값 비싸고 서울을 거쳐 가려면 시간이 많이 걸렸습니다.다른 곳에서 시간을 보내십시오. 당신이 상자에서 이것을 똑딱 똑바로 쓰고 싶지 않다면."
"최고 긴 줄 때문에 nami 섬 에를 가로 질러 줄을 지퍼로 나아 가지 않았다. 그러나 연락선 타기는 단지 약 10-15 분의 짧은 주파수와 더불어, 멋졌다. 남이섬의 가을은 단풍 나무가 풍부하고 가을 색이 전체를 덮어서 놀랍습니다. 나는 멋진 추운 날씨와 결합되는 그것의 모든 작은 조각을 좋아했고, 우리가 자전거 타기와 함께 전체의 섬을 포함 할 수 있었을 정도로 우리가 더 오랫동안 머물 렀 더라면 좋고, 차가워지고, 모든보기에 잠겼다. 그러나 그럼에도 불구하고, 그것은 확실히 가을의 계절에 갈 가치가 있어요!"
아름다운 섬 섬의 끝까지 모든 길을 걸었습니다. 그리고 그만한 가치가있었습니다. 놀라운 전망과 확실히 돌아올 것입니다.
그림 그리기가 생생하게! 가 불타는 빨간색과 활기찬 노란색의 버스트. 놀라운 장소!
"가을에 가족과 함께 갔다. 처음으로 한국에 발을 들여 놓고 가을을 경험 한 것은 처음이었습니다. 장소는 정말로 정말로 아름다웠고 불가사의했다. 그것은 색으로 붕괴 된 그림과 같았고 온도는 정말로 차갑습니다. 열대 지방에서 왔지만 우리는 날씨를 절대적으로 좋아했습니다! 우리는 섬에가는 연락선 보트를 가져 갔다. 그러나 섬으로가는 길을 계획하는 옵션도 있습니다. 그 곳은 걷기 좋은 흔적입니다. 왜냐하면 모든 구석이 훌륭하기 때문입니다! 동물들은 자유롭게 장소를 돌아 다닙니다. 우리도 우리가 발견했지만 특이하지만 귀여운 공작 나무를 발견했습니다. 은행 나무, 세쿼이아, 그리고 일본 단풍 나무 차선은 숨이 막힐뿐입니다. 당신이 워커 타입이 아니거나 걷는 것에별로 신경 쓰지 않는다면 거기에 앉아서보기를 들으면 다른 최상의 옵션이 될 것입니다. 배고프거나 갈증을 느끼는 일은 결코 카페와 레스토랑으로 가득차 있기 때문에 결코 문제가되지 않습니다. 장갑과 따뜻한을 파는 가게도 있습니다. 절대로 장소를 사랑하고 언제나 컴백하는 것을 좋아합니다!"

"Interesting To Do in Nami Island This island somehow reminds me of Gili Trawangan in Lombok, Indonesia.  In the middle of serene, no vehicles, so peaceful.  Two options for amuse yourself circling the place; either cycling or walking.  I chose the second option and enjoying myself very much.  Listen to sound of wind and feel the breeze.  Well, you know Korea, even it's spring but the temperature still low.  A cup of hot chocolate make my half day in Nami so perfect.  It's very relaxing and I could feel myself recharging from the routine.  That's how Nami to me."
너무 아름다워!
"우리와 ktx를 가져 가지 않았기 때문에 나와 나의 친구는 꽤 늦게 거기에 도착했고, 예상보다 조금 늦게 밖에 갔다. 그래서 우리는 남이 섬의 많은 부분을 탐험하지 못했습니다. 그러나 그것은 여전히 놀라운 경험이었습니다. chipmunks와 토끼도 있었다! 당신이 거기에 갈 계획이라면 슈퍼 일찍 깨우고 ktx 티켓을 미리 구입하십시오. 가능한 한 많은 시간을 할애하십시오. 또한, 우리는 보트로 거기에 도착했다. 그러나 theres는 또한 zipline에 갈 옵션이었다. 나는 당신이 거기의 장소를 임대 할 수 있는지에 관해 명확히하지 않는다. 그러나 나는 빌려주 어 졌던 아파트 또는 무엇인가 보였던 약간의 작은 건물을 보았다. 그래서 그것을 조사해야한다!"
셀카를위한 좋은 장소 나미는 자연의 섬이 아니지만 환경은 괜찮 았고 사진을 찍는 데 많은 코너가있었습니다. 나는 큰 공원 같았습니다.
Visit either by fall or winter Visiting here by fall or winter will ensure you get the best colors for Nami Island.Expect hordes of tourists though.The entire island is very walkable and it will be best to avoid the crowd at the periphery of the island.
"Beautiful I really love the view in Nami Island. It was so stunning and you can do a lot of stuff in there and one of it is you can rent a bike and cycling around the island Worn out place It's not very well maintaine, things are falling apart.. it's 17 years since the famous drama which turns this place into a tourist attraction.Now it's quiet and peaceful, and that's about it.. not sure if it's worth travelling such distance for a place like this Disappointing Not worth the trip.There isn't anything particular about this island except that its crowded.  Unless sentiment from winter sonata adds extra personal value.. One of the last most visited places I would recommend a friend or family travelling from abroad."
"가을의 아름다운 황금 나뭇잎 그것은 가을에 방문하기에 정말 아름다운 곳입니다. 서명 나무 차선을 따라 붐비는 슈퍼를 제외하면. 여행 환경 설정에 따라 1 시간에서 2 시간 반 정도 소요되는 작은 섬.남이섬에서 무엇을 먹고 먹을 수 있는지, ""joogostyle tag Nami Island"" 가을 서울에서의 당일 여행 놀라 울 정도로 아름다운 단풍은 비오는 날에도 우리의 비전 감각에 큰 즐거움을 선사합니다. 점심 시간과 시력을 보는데 충분한 시간을 갖기 위해 정오 이전에 도착하고 출발하는 것이 좋습니다. 페리를 반납하기 위해 큰 러시와 방대한 대기열 (또는 거대한 관중이 이동하기 때문에 대기열이 없음) 전에."
"Worthy Nami Island is situated about 90 minutes train-ride away from Seoul, tour bus ride from the Gapyeong station and ferry ride from the terminal. It is certainly worth the travel.Beautiful landscaping with so many photo taking opportunities. However they need to station more staff to help tourists with information and directions.Trip to Korea will not complete without visiting Nami Island."

"목가적 인 남이섬의 고요한 분위기와 자연 그대로의 아름다움은 한국을 여행 할 때 반드시 필요한 것입니다. 서울에서 버스로 단 몇 분이면 도착할 수있는 섬이 많습니다. 이 섬은 히트 Kdrama Winter Sonata의 촬영 장소로 가장 인기가 있지만, 할 일이 많습니다. 정원, 숲과 통로뿐만 아니라 음식 상점 / 레스토랑과 기념품 가게가 많습니다. 많은 관광 명소가 사진에 적합합니다. 섬 너머로 갈수록 관광객 수는 줄어 듭니다. 섬을 돌아 다니는 전차와 관광 버스는 걷는 것을 좋아하지 않는 사람들에게 유용합니다. 자전거 대여도 옵션입니다. 섬을 오가는 짧은 페리를 타면 해안을 따라 볼 수 있습니다."
"M 도덕적 인 남이섬은 은행 직원이었고 퇴직 기금을 소지 한 개인에게 소속되어 있습니다. 그것은 은퇴 후퇴와 가족 휴양지가 될 예정 이었지만 가슴이 바뀌 었습니다. 휴가가 시작되기 전에 학생들에게 휴일 bbq n 캠프가 열려있었습니다.그의 좋은 친구, 조경 개발자 덕분에 매년 전에, 그것은 자연의 아름다움을 향해 손질되었습니다. 군중이 아니더라도 고요함."
대단한 경치 나는 겨울 동안 방문한다. 그리고 그들이 방문자와 그 전체를 위해 형성했던 눈이 내린다. 눈썰매를 타고 사진을 찍을 수 있습니다. 직원은 매우 도움이된다.
"Nami Island visit during March (Spring Festival period) Nami Island is a must visit place if you are visiting Korea. I would venture to say that even if you are just touring Icheon or Seoul. A trip to Gangwon to visit Nami Island is worth it. We visited for only a couple of hours (whole afternoon) so it is not a full experience I'm sharing here.SOME NOTES:We visited as a family and as part of a tour group we were definitely milling around a few hundred people on the island. We visited during spring, it is the best time in my opinion.LIKE!1). Take in the scenery - The main focus of Nami Island is how well the place is maintained. I like the beautiful landscaping or how the different trees, grass, and flowers are blended to give you a serene and picture/instragrammable place. We even chanced upon a group who were almost finished doing a nuptial photoshoot.2). Ferry-trip - I liked how the ferry had a regular transit to-and-from the island. You didn't really have to wait very long to get on a ferry. Plus, the trip was pleasant as you get to see different places within the vicinity before landing on the island. It was also very clean and you really didn't have any worry during the short trip.3). Lots of shops and restaurants -  They had different shops offering souvenir items of all kinds/types/sizes, some like the more modern t-shirts, trinkets, toys. And the more traditional ones like hand-carved / wood-crafted items. You won't get hungry here as there are several shops where you can get food from finger foods to full restaurants.CAN BE  IMPROVED1). Tourism / Promotion - I liked the novelty of Nami Island having its own 'government' and currency but didn't really get to experience what the goal of having this was. It was just a curious aspect of the visit for me. Maybe have something more geared towards tourist who just visits the island once and for a few hours only.2). Long ferry trip - I'm not sure if it was intentional, but I felt the ferry was traveling really slow. I didn't believe such a short trip would take more than 30mins (actual travel time only) to get to the island.3). Lack of personnel - I noticed during our visit that not all the shops were open, and there were hardly any person whom tourists can approach if they had questions or concerns. I just saw the maintenance people (like gardeners and attendants) pruning the grass and cleaning the fields. It would help if they had a couple of people dedicated to helping tourists with any questions or help they needed.CONCLUSION:People have different preferences. Some people like the festive atmosphere of crowds in a place like Nami Island, some would prefer a more serene moment in this place. Definitely visit during spring, it is the best time in my opinion, but be prepared for the tourist crowd during spring. It's their busiest season."
Wonder walk Walked thru Nami Island and amazed with the natural scenery and plentiful man made structure and scalpture. Truely wonderful 잊을 수없는 추억 섬 자체 아름다운 경치를 가지고 가지. 서울로 여행하는 경우 반드시 방문해야합니다.
좋은 장면 우리는 거기에 도달하는 먼 길을가는 동안 정말로 그 장소를 즐긴다. 우리는 많은 사진을 찍었습니다. 아이들은 영화에서와 같이 장소와 장면을 정말로 즐깁니다.
매혹적인 섬 남이 섬. 매혹적인 섬. isalnd에 갈 수 있기 전에 섬을 가로 질러 보트를 탈 필요가 있습니다. 보트에는 좌석이 없지만 섬으로 건너는 데 몇 분이 걸렸을 까 걱정하지 않습니다. 우리는 겨울에 거기에 간다. 그리고 그것은 매우 추 웠고 많은 관광객이었다.섬은 한국 영화의 일부 장소로 유명합니다. 저기에 여러 가지 한국의 나무가 있지만 겨울에는 잎사귀가 모두 없어집니다. 남이섬과 기념품 가게 안에는 음식 마차가 있습니다. 당신은 심지어 nami 섬 주위를 돌아 다닐 자전거를 빌릴 수 있습니다.
"매혹적인 장면 남이섬의 가을은이 계절에 더 아름답습니다! 한때 무성한 녹색 식물이었던 황색, 오렌지색 및 붉은 색채가 풍부하다는 것을 상상해보십시오! 그 장면은 놀랍고 마술 적입니다."
Our first trip..
"This is our first trip together, the island was good not that crowded and food was ok too.. rather cold for December."

Best shot in autumn!
"I went there in both winter and autumn... different beauty of island. If you are sonata fans, recommend to visit in autumn when we can see beauty of leaves."
"Zipline is worth it At first I thought nobody ziplines to Nami Island in winter so I booked ferry tickets.On the ferry ride to the island we saw 2 people ziplining. So we took the ferry back and ziplined there again.The zipline ends at a different spot from where the ferry docks on the island. It ends along a scenic cycling route.The zipline ticket counter is different from the ferry ticket counter. It is located in the zipline tower.We took the lift up, the crew set up the equipment, and we were off in about 5 minutes.I thought we could buy photos at the end but I didn't dare to ask the crew. Maybe I should've asked."

"A day walk in Nami Island covering in snow, greeted by the chilly wind , warming up ourselves at the firewood eating hot sausages/ snack, and ice cream are great experience! Not forgetting all the camera worthy sceneries!"
Fun but without the snow Really looking forward to the visit but did not get the white snow. Either snow has come and gone or not there yet.A lot of other activities to pass your time there.
"Not just for Winter Sonata fans I booked a tour to Nami Island + Garden of Morning Calm on Klook. During the tour, I learned that Nami Island was named after General Nami who died at the age of 26 and was buried on the island. It took around 1 hour plus by bus from Seoul to Nami. Once you reach the jetty, you can choose either to take a ferry or zipline (at additional charge) to the island. Attractions on the island include General Nami tomb, Elysian waterfall, Winter Sonata filming location, Winter Sonata statue, and Winter Sonata first kiss. I rented a bike and managed to cover the entire island in less than an hour. For Muslim travellers, there's a halal restaurant on the island (Asian Cuisine Restaurant). The restaurant menu includes halal Korean dishes such as bulgogi and dakgalbi."
Nice!
Went to nami island during winter but still not snowing yet but really really cold. Small cute island with loads of area for a good photography session.
Crowded but worth the shot in autumn!
"I Intentionally skipped this tourist spot the first time I went in korea. because I’ve read lots of reviews that this place is always crowded. I give it a try in this next visit to feed my curiosity. To skip the hassle by commuting, we rent a car, gladly my cousin’s husband is a korean and have access where to rent a car from locals (because renting a car from a company is very expensive) and nami island is very far from Seoul. (Literally) anyway, Line for a ferry was too long but the view was fascinating specially in autumn. When we arrived, it’s indeed very crowded! You can’t even find a good spot to get a clear shots with the famous ginkgo trees! (If I’m not mistaken) But nevertheless we did our best to have our own “famous photo”. I think best to visit here is autumn and winter. We came a little early in October as we didn’t get the chance to witness the awesome autumn of this place. I don’t recommend this for summer, it will be look pretty plain and I think a waste of money and time. But I recommend this place to those who will visit alone or with friends to join a tour package, The money will be worth it. Spent 2 1/2 hour here with picture taking  and eating, (food here is expensive for average consumers) we enjoyed Italian pizza! then we proceed to petite France and garden of morning calm. This three attractions are very far from each other, like 45-1 hour away each! so renting a car was a good idea in our case. All in all still worth the shot! Just come very early. I will visit this exactly in autumn next time by mid October to early November, and for winter."
"A fitting tribute to a great warrior A must place of visit in Seoul and if you’re a nature lover, never miss it. One of the main tourist attractions in Seoul ,this place boosts of large foot falls in all seasons. The island has a entirely different look during each season making it very popular among the tourists and also the local population. During spring one can see the trees blooming with flowers and many visit this place to enjoy the snow draped trees in winter.Named over General Nami who was known for his courage and died at an young age of 26, this island has a swimming pool, a large open grass field in the middle, water boats, water skiing, roller skating ring, a hotel /resort and a many cafes and restaurants. There is also a bicycle rental service ,which is very popular used by many to go around this island which is covers a circumference of around 5 kms.This island can be reached thru a ferry or thru a zip line. But to return back to the main land, one needs to opt for ferry only.This place is around 65 kms from the Seoul and based on the time you can spare, the visit can be around 4-5 hours to full day.One can also reach this place very early morning and then club the visit other attraction nearby. The best option would be to opt for a room at the Island  hotel or resort and enjoy the stay.If you are a small family of 3-4, then hire a taxi and if you are a group of 7-8 members, then hiring a Jumbo taxi would be the best option. For individuals and on visiting on limited budget ,there are Shuttle bus services from Insadong, Mandaemun and Myeongdong or one can take a train and get down at Gapyeong Station which is around 2 kms away from Nami Island."
"private trip to mount sorak and nami island The trip was super fun and relax. The tour guide was so kind, humorous and friendly, he was good at explaining the attractions and it kept our attention during the trip. Mount Sorak is a place that must visit in Korea because it has a beautiful view and it gives us a different view of Korea. Name island is also an interesting place for tourist to visit, it has many games and much more to explore in this island. lastly, I appreciated the tour guide's used of language and he really did a good job and being active throughout the trip. Thanks a lot and we really did have fun in this trip!"

Not enough time!!!!
"We follow the shuttle with island ticket tour from Seoul. Journey starts from 10:30 from Seoul. It’s not that far, about an hour.The place is just too pretty. I’m a guy that likes to soak in as much as possible, and not just rushing to take all the best location shots. so i didn’t manage to finish the place as I would’ve like.Since it was winter there’s man made wintery attractions like sledding which my daughter enjoy very much and decided to just park herself in the sledding park, in the end we did half the island as the tour bus leaves at 4pm.I suppose the best way to enjoy this island is either drive in as early as possible, if you rent a car or perhaps arrange to stay a night either on the island or at the port. It’s worth it."
December visit.
"Visited this island as part of a tour package and spent about 2.5 hours here. The ambient temperature was around -3deg, which makes the hot drinks and snacks a wonderful treat.Was told this location was used for the Korean drama - Winter Sonata. Beautiful scenery and a tranquil calm makes this place attractive and worthy of photos A Visit to Nami Island This island is a great place to visit at least for once. Despite Nami Island is not a very big place, however, it is very cosy and welcoming to tourist and visitors who would like to experience something different and loving couples. For adventurous people, one can visit the island via zip wire instead of ferry. It is quite challenging and exciting."
"Unimaginable beautiful view Very nice place to visit. The pictures say everything. The ticket for one person is around 52000 Korean Won. The cruise will take to the island. There is also a zip lining which can directly take to the island. The best time to visit this place is at the end of October and starting the week of November. If you have DSLR then you can have nice photography. It's a romantic destination. The restaurants are available. If you are a vegetarian, then you can have vegetarian pizza. The restroom is also there. You can enjoy high-speed boat ride by spending some money."
Worth a visit !!
We had an organized tour that took us to Nami Island which is almost 2 hours from Seoul. Probable winter isn't the right season to visit the Island and if it was autumn or Spring we would have truly enjoyed the beautiful island with greenery all around. In December it was too cold. A walk through the island and around the edge of the lake was nice and refreshing. There are lots of restaurants and Cafe to take care of your hunger and you can easily spend 3/4 hours in the Island. Worth the visit.
"Nice stroll around the island it is quite far from Seoul, you have to take ITX to Gapyeong Station, the journey took about 1 hour+ After reaching Gapyeong Station, you need to take another bus which is 1-time fees and allow you to visit multi places.After dropping at nami island station, you need to buy another ticket to take short ferry ride (which is the entry fees). of course there are some restaurant for you to take a break before taking the ferry to the island.Alternatively, you can take this zipline shooting you through the mid-air directly to nami island, which cost a little bit more money.Nami island is great, I visited in September, weather was cooler and nice walking around the island though there's not much of autumn activities to do other than buggy car around the island and scenery photo taking..."
"Probably best during spring or autumn Winter may be too harsh for one to truly appreciate this place. I will suspect spring or autumn with the leaves of different shades to be more magical. We took the long way of hopping from one subway line to the next to reach Gapyeong. On the way back, it was much faster in the ITX line from Gapyeong to Yongsan."
"Getting in touch with nature Our tour guide was right: Nami Island is enjoyed by walking and getting in touch with nature. Our family walked in the freezing cold (we visited during a harsh winter) and enjoyed every bit of it. Bonfires were in place at certain points to kerp you warm. There is a troll bridge, snowboarding area, an ostrich pen, (frozen ice) fountains and coffee shops and restaurants that offer a warm break."
"Very cold and nice scenery Recommended for half day trip to this beautiful place.Entry and ferry ticket for adult costs 13,000 won and 10,000 won for youths.Lots of Muslim friendly restaurants and rest place to chill and relax.Cheers Only 60+ kms from Seoul, and worth a visit My partner and I were lucky to visit Namiseom (or more commonly Nami) Island at the beginning of November, right in the middle of the Autumn fall period. As a result we not only got to experience the island itself, but the brilliant autumnal colours of the leaves on the trees, from brilliant red, to bright orange and outstanding yellows.The island is actually in the middle of a lake, but has no bridges to it, even though only about 200 metres from the surrounds of the lake. All travel to the island is via one, of a number of, boats that provide the traverse experience.There is much to see on this narrow, and longish island. Plenty of accommodation facilities, restaurants, food outlets etc., although eating on the island can be somewhat expensive. There are plenty of easy walks around the island, with so many beautiful views. It is a VERY easy walk because the entire island is almost totally flat, with no hills or mountains. A reasonably casual walk around the entire island can take you between 1 - 1.5 hours, but by its very nature and design, you can cut short your walk at almost anytime, and return back to the boat port via another easy path. Well worth a visit.And if you have the option, try to do it in Autumn fall time (end of October and first two weeks of November) when you will have the added bonus of the beautiful colours adding to the impressive views that the island has to offer."

"nice island visit First time there, and everything was as expected.  boat ride, many beautiful place for pictures，a number of street food stores.  can easily spend 3-4 hours.  If going near lunch time, restaurants could be crowded, so consider packing own food.while you are there definitely go for the rail bike - Super fun.  There are few options, so be sure to clarify locations before booking (booking highly recommended) in case arriving at the wrong locations."
"Beautiful island Beautiful island.  Only 4 restaurants avail. One of the restaurants, the Korean cuisine needs to order compulsory two sets for each selection. Wierd rules. Suggest to get your food at the harbour before or after the island tour at the jetty."
"Nice Natural Setting I took an ITX from Wangsimni, and had to change trains at Cheongnyangngi; if not sure, ask the officials around and they will direct you to the right trains. Alight at Gapyeong.If you have purchased a single trip train ticket, be sure to get your deposit of 500 won back. Just insert your card into refund deposit machine to get your money back.Across the road from the Gapyeong train station is the bus stop. We waited for a long time for the shuttle bus to Nami Island Ferry Point. In the end, we took a taxi. The standard fare was 6,000 won per taxi.Nami Island is known for its scenery, its shooting location for Winter Sonata at the Metasequoia lane. Enjoy the stroll amidst the natural setting. :)) S C E N I C Nami Island is a must visit when in Korea ~ The whole island is a photo shoot location! 3 hours definitely not enough for those who loves posing for pictures xD There was a dog gallery; with cute doggy pictures and even displaying fake doggos that looked so real. Downside was too many people! Difficult to get the amazing pics you see online as there were photobombers everywhere."
"Nice Place to Visit, Expensive Food and Coffee It's a great place to walk around, take pictures, and just generally relax and take in the fresh air and scenery. When we went it was nearing winter so the trees were mostly bare. The food in the restaurants and the coffee were a lot pricier so I suggest getting your lunch and coffee before getting on the ferry into Nami Island. If you're in a tour group and you need to get back at a certain time, make sure to catch the ferry 30 minutes before your scheduled departure because there's a lot of people waiting to get back too."
"Beautiful Island, but it is not a must visit place Nami Island is located around 60 kms away from Seoul. We took ITX from Yongsan Station to Gapyeong Station, then took bus to the island using transit bus. Quite easy to access.The island's main attraction is several lanes with different types of trees line along the lanes. Besides, there are several man-made structures, a few rows of shops, and an ostrich farm on the island.For K-drama follower, the island means a lot as a filming location of several k-drama. Well, the one that brought the island to the eyes of the world is Winter Sonata. The filming locations were marked with special signage on the island.We visited the island during autumn. It was really beautiful with endless stretch of autumn-coloured foliage. We spent around 2 hours 30 minutes on the island. Food and beverages were available (the price was high), and there were plenty of resting area.We enjoyed walking around the island. Anyway, we would suggest renting a bicycle might be a better way of touring around the island. Please read our blog to know more about how to travel from Seoul to the island via public transport. More beautiful photos are available as well.Is it a must-visit place nearby Seoul? We would say- no. However, it is a place that good-to-go, if you have a whole day to spare. By the way, instead of going to Petite French or the Garden of the Morning Calm, pay a short visit to Gapyeong Town and take a ride on Rail Park are great options as well."
"Gloomy trees yet refreshing We took subway to Yongsan station & catch ITX train to Gapyeong about an hr ride. Exit Gapyeong station, there's tourist information counter, get bus time table & q for bus. Pay cash to bus driver 6000 won when board the bus, u can hope up & down several attractions with the ticket so don lose it!Our first stop Nami. Alight bus, walk about 8min to reach the wharf, no q, get ticket to Nami (include ferry both ways), it's not crowded, board ferry but waited for a while for it to move guess they try to fill up as many pple as possible for each ride.Nami to me is nothing much interesting (guess autumn would be lovely but will be flooded with pple & too noisy).Nice to take photo with rows of trees without leaves, feel gloomy yet refreshing.Had lunch in korean BBQ restaurant (so so) & continue explore the area, about 3 hr include lunch is enough for us. Tried the red bean sticky cake near the fire place, warm & nice.Nice to have fire place around to beat the cold, was -5Board the return ferry, waited quite a while again before it move as they try to fill up with pple before depart. At the end miss the bus by about 8min to Petite France & took taxi there cost about 18K wonFerry to Nami island is fast like less than 10min, but waiting time on the ferry is rather long, hope they can improve on this for those who come by shuttle bus & need to be on time for the bus for next destination."
Beauty of Nami Beautiful .. Before i go there. Hmm.. How excited i am.. Then when im here...woww..  Yesss for sure i will came again..one fine day. 😁 Beautiful! But....
The place is beautiful as advertised. But too crowded. One can’t really enjoy the place as some tourists are so noisy.
Not for me!
"Friend picked me up at airport, and showed me around his home area.Nami Island, a world heritage site( ?) a 1 1/2 hour drive way from the city.People everywhere come to this site.i was told that A NUMBER OF Japanese/photographers fly in specially to photograph the Avenue of Gingko trees.To me it’s just a bit of an island with some trees,flowers, rocks, Grass shrubs... I was bored,it wasn’t my scene, but, I feigned interest to show that I appreciated his efforts!!!!But the many who were there, WERE NOT LIKE ME!!!! I have NO  APPRECIATION for land scenes, for the MONA LISA etc etc..I am an ignorant, crass, blind non art seeing person!!To me, the climax of the journey, was  the  two matching rows of Ginkgo trees.. they were straight!!!!!I personally would not waste my time  to come here !But, my friend was gushing with pride and enthusiasm!So, how can this ignoramus, critique a World Heritage Site??With a hand on my heart,and OPEN EYES CLOSED...it’s autumn here now. Fallen leaves cover the ground around the trees, whose trunks are now winter wrapped in hessian cloth, and Xmas lighting are being fixed along the branches.A 5min ferry ride to access this island, in the middle of a river."

A must visit for all first timers.
"A beautiful island, famous as the backdrop for Korean Drama Winter Sonata. Nothing much really but a nice getaway.  For thrill-seekers, try ziplining to the island.  I was too chicken and besides the weather was too cold.Easy to get to.  Don't bother to go on your own, although you can.  Save the hassle. There are plenty of tours which you can book.  Mine was only SGD47, from Klook, to Nami and Petite France from 8am to 4.30pm.  The guide was so experienced that we knew the must-see and where the poster perfect shots should be taken."
"Beautiful Island Beautiful, peaceful island in Korea. Came here during end November, nice place for taking beautiful photos.Booked my round trip transport traveling with coach via Klook with pick up from Myeongdong. Journey takes around 1.5 hours drive. Upon reaching, you will need to take a ferry which will take you to Nami Island.Island is full of tourists, many of them so it’s quite hard to take pictures with clear background.All the leaves have fallen hence most trees are bare. However scenery is still beautiful. You will come across to wild Ostrich area too.There are a number of restaurants around too. Definitely worth a trip here if you are a tourist."
A beautiful island I loved the place.Establishments there are pretty over-priced but I understand that it's a tourist spot.But seeing the different views and locations of the island was really breathtaking.
Great Visit It was nice visiting the island. it's just a short ferry trip there. everything there was so clean and well maintain. My kids like the island so much.
Beautiful!
We went there in autumn and it was beautiful. Well preserved and maintained. The fall foliage against the blue sky is stunning.
"Nice scenery Went during late autumn/ early winter and the view was breathtaking. Different kinds of tall trees are planted around the island. Some spots were apparently the filming locations for Winter Sonata so if you are into that, this might be a spot not to be missed."
"Island of seasons From Gapyeong station take the city bus unli at 6000Won per person. They will give you a table of their schedule pick up and drop off. Interval between buses is 10 to 20 mins so you can time your stops in order to make it back on time.All foods or maybe 95% in the island costs 3000Won... bbq, sausages, ice cream... but nothing we ate was spectacular.  All was just enough to keep your stomach full...Try to schedule an entire day so you can enjoy the place. It's worth every minute of your stroll.Tip: book your return ticket at Gapyeong station with reserved seats as soon as you arrive. MAKE SURE you DON'T MISS IT! IF you VISIT IN THE COLDER MONTHS, THIS PLACE WILL BE MUCH COOLER EVEN :) Winter sonata This place is famous for winter sonata... if you’re hallyu you must visit here... there’s boat that take you to Nami island... this place called naminara republic by local korean... very very good place... there’s 1 tomb for general nami on Nami so you must be careful (location before wood road nearby water, you can see on nami map)..."
Icon of Chuncheon It is a very famous site in Chuncheon. Travelers should take ship to this island where have many restaurants and walking paths. It would be very beautiful with different colors of maple leaves In Autumn.

"A beautiful place for autumn If you have been a fan of love-themed Korean dramas, this is the place to visit.  Lovely for couples as the surroundings are really romantic and beautiful.  Great for rekindling the love of those who have been jaded through many years of marriage.Here is also where you will be able to capture many a beautiful pictures to add to your library of beautiful places to visit.  It is also convenient as good, clean toilets are everywhere and cafes as well as snack counters are plenty.  There are regular schedules for the short boat trips from the mainland.There is also an interesting origin and history to Nami Island."
"Getaway from the city :D As an avid traveler, people always mentioned about Nami Island, and my first thought is that its a tourist trap! Yes it is, but i find it to be quite a beautiful place most especially in the winter! We were actually lucky to catch the first snowfall, although we originally went there for autumn. Play in an actual winter wonderland. There is quite a lot of people, but they come and go due to tour group schedules so you'll be able to find empty places for pics!P.s. Making a snowman is not that easy. Lol Very colorful in autumn, but crowded I visited Nami Island several times. I was there again towards the end of Oct., 2018 (Sunday); it was a disappointment as It was raining. Unless you have never been to Nami Island before, try your very best not to go there on a rainy weekend. To make up for the loss, I re-visited it a week later, in early Nov. It was sunny but the approaching road was heavily congested. The maple and ginkgo trees seemed to have lost much of their glamour over the week. Nevertheless Nami Island is one of the best places to visit when you are in Seoul; it is so relaxing. I pre-booked online a return trip on the official Nami shuttle bus (Insa-dong -- Nami Island), via Trazy. It was an excellent arrangement. (Although the bus departs at 0930 from Insa-dong and at 1600 from Nami, the nett duration for walking around is perhaps under 3 hours, ie minus the lunch time, the traffic jam and queuing for the ferry.) Ths bus ride was comfortable and the driver was courteous. The best time to see the golden ginkgo trees is late Oct.; for red maples it is early Nov."
"Must visit Dreaming island .. beautiful place to spend the day .. a lot of activities a fun ... amazing place to take a lot of pictures , a mixture of colors and charming views Nice fall day BUT TOO MUCH TRAIN Visiting Nami Island it’s a very good and relaxing experience, more living in Seoul. Getting away from all the traffic noise and just enjoying a bit of nature it’s very nice, and the food selection offered in the island it’s varied and tasty BUT please keep in mind that it takes A LONG TIME to get there from Seoul and you would only spend 3-4 hours walking around on average.Beautiful to go during autumn!"
Absolutely stunning!
"This island is an absolute treasure in autumn! The colours were spectacular. The island has restaurants, accommodation and entertainment areas but if you go for the trees  you won't be disappointed! We spent several hours here, took over 350 photos and left feeling that we had had one of our best days in Korea! Just make sure you see it during the week, because it is absolutely crammed with people from everywhere in Korea at weekends!!"
"Nice trip I've gone there at the winter. I dont see any yellow leaf and the autumn forrest. However, I love this place and I want to comeback."
"Touristy crowded island We came around mid Nov. A lot of leaves already fell but its still a beautiful Island. Sad to said that its too touristy and crowded even till evening. Tour group after tour group just kept coming in! Its challenging to snap a nice photo unless you go to other less well known scenery spot. To escape the crowd, likely you have to stay in the island but I got a feeling that after 7am (first cruse) crowd will start coming in.Will not visit again, because i just hate the crowd!"
"beautiful island Nami is beautiful in all seasons. Lots of trees, beautiful coast line, quaint houses and hotels. A 2-3hr visit as a day triper would suffice.  Ferries run every 10-20min from the mainland."
New World Yes! what i mean is u exactly will feel like u enter a new world i means everythg in there the beauty scenery food attraction game go picnic snack a show like literally including toilet. hahahha i meant everythg! it really makes u feel to live there! Take noted that price shown in most of bloggers did was ended so u have to pay at the price in there's stated. Slightly different/.  Make sure to bring some extra money and ferry fee including round tickets.

"Lovers' Paradise Nami Island - Strongly recommended day trip. Even if bus loads or should I say ferry loads of tourists come to visit, there's enough room for everyone. Our tourist guide took us a different route and we didn't have to join the parade of tourists to explore the island. We worked our way back through the main walk/path to get a view and feel of the Island's main attraction - tree lined road carpeted with fall colored leaves.Made more famous by the Korean love story, drama series Winter Sonata, it sure is a lovers' paradise.It is definitely family friendly too. Kids playgrounds are also available."
Spell bound...
I was speechless and it was so beautiful. We visited in autumn (2nd Nov) from Seoul and seems to be the best time. Trees with beautiful colours. There is so much things to do and can easily spend the whole day. From Gapyeong rail station its just 20-30 mins walk (we went by walk as there was heavy traffic). Then you have to buy ticket and take boat (included in tickets) to Nami island. Or you can take zip line for more adventure. A must visit place in South Korea.
Autumn visit Went in end oct and unfortunately some of the leaves have withered. There are still some trees here and there in full bloom in yellow and red. Can causally walk for about 2-3 hours taking photos and laze around. Full of tourists place. Their red bean pancake is yummy and it’s red bean latte (mentioned in menu is seasonal).
"Simply Beautiful Nami Island is a very beautiful place. We were there at the beginning of autumn. Weather was nice and the leaves were starting to change colour. For those who love to take photos, this will be the perfect place to do so."
Beautiful in autumn We bought our tour ticket from Klook which just arranged for return coach and ferry ticket. It took about 1 1/2 hour to reach the jetty to cross over to Nami Island. It’s so beautiful in autumn (I was there in May previously) and everywhere you turn it’s a great scenery. We spent 4 hours on the island walking around including taking a break for lunch. Many restaurants on the island but food is generally more expensive on the island. It’s definitely worth visiting.
"Tourist Factory Sure the nature is beautiful and people say you haven't been to South Korea if you haven't stepped a foot here.BUTThis place is so small and the crowds are so large.I went there to expect nature and enjoy it quietly but instead I found noisy tourists everywhere. Seriously, walked around the whole island and did not find a spot without other people. You can't take proper picture because there are people every 2 meters.There were very limited restaurant options in the island, eash has looooooooonnnnnngggggg queue. We chose the traditional one, and the food was good."
"Beautiful If you are traveling free and easy, suggestion is to go to Nami Island early to avoid the Tour group.- We took the 6am ITX (KRW 5,900 book online and print the ticket) from Yongsan Station (stayed at Airbnb nearby) to Gapyeong Station (arrive 7am)- took a taxi (KRW 3,700) to Nami Island ticket booth (KRW 13,000). Ferry schedule is about half an hour and takes 5 minutes to reach the island.Advantage of going early is you get to take beautiful photos without human bombs at the back of your photos."
"Nami Island This place is part of our tour.  But during the time we visited, it was raining heavily.  We enjoyed some hot drinks in a coffee shop while waiting for the rain to stop.  Lucky enough the rain stop after an hour.  So our time then was limited to explore the area.  The fact that it was also crowded with so many tourist during our visit in Nami Island makes it difficult to find beautiful spots without any other person in the way.   The autumn leaves are blooming it's vibrant colors which came out great in photos.    Definitely a beautiful area to visit when you are vacationing in Korea."
"Cold Nami Experience We went in December - not quite winter yet, but very cold to warm blooded Singaporean.  It was nice still and very scenic with lots of tourists despite the cold or because of the cold weather.  Will go again during spring the next time."
"Beautiful Fall I was there when early autumn season in mid October. It was really beautiful, the leaves start to red and yellow. loving so much the color hue, green, red and yellow, it so beautiful!Go there early in the morning (first ferry will be on 07.30 AM) if you can, to avoid the crowd."

October Best time to Visit Really beautiful during autumn.  Best time to visit but also too many people.  Best to go early in the morning maybe less crowded and also more time for picture taking and more time to go relax and try the restaurant.
"Day trip to Nami Island Take a tour from Seoul to Nami island and the Petite France. It was on Saturday and there are thousands of visitors there. First take a boat trip to the island. The island is famous in the autumn watching the red and yellow leaves. People with camera and it is jamming in every main road with trees line up at the island. I hired a bike and biking around the island and it was fun and we are enjoyed it. Tips, if you dare to ride the flying cable from the car park side to the island, And then take the ferry back to the car park entrance. But there are lots of people waiting."
Beautiful Nami island in autumn Truly scenic and clean island.Tourist friendly with ample amenitiesBe prepared for rain and lots of visitors.
Best Visit in Autumn!
"only an hour from Seoul, this is also a worthy place to visit. The autumn color of Nami Island is super pretty! better to visit it during workday, avoid holiday or weekend to get the best pics without so many crowd."
Beautiful Autumn !!
Best place to enjoy autumn!But you can't believe the crowd that visited this place. I was there on Friday around 12pm. Both locals and foreigners are flocking into this island as this is one of the attraction you mush visit when you are in Korea. I will advise you guys to go earlier so that it will not be too crowded.There's around 5 or 6 restaurants in the island. But I didn't get to try any of them because I need to wait at least 1hr for a table there. Try their Nami Sausages (it is nice!) and some other snacks. You can have your meal outside the island.
Stunning!!!
We went towards the end of October and autumn colours was just beautiful! We got here very early to beat the crowds. We are glad we did as it started to get very busy as we was leaving and I can imagine the line for the ferry would be quite long later on in the day. Definitely recommend if you love nature and walking around.
"Nami Island An hour from Seoul, visit to Nami Island includes a very short boay ride. Autumn colors  are a sight, except that it was peak season for tourists. Walking along the shore was quiet. Best to walk around and get food to go. Avoid sitting in a restaurant, since time in Nami Island is limited."
Foliage at its best.
We were very happy with our day trip to Nami Island. The island was beautiful. It is a privately owned island wherein the owner planted lots and lots of trees. Today the island is a nature sanctuary. Grown trees with various colors and open spaces make the island great for picnic and outdoor activities.Stream and lakes surround the island. Scenic views and great landscaping make the island a great place to visit. During fall season various colors of the leaves make it a visual feast. It’s about 1.5 hours away from Seoul. You need to ride a 5 minute ferry to reach the island. Another way to get to the island is via zipline. Our tour was organized by Top tours Korea.
"Perfect for Fall Season but crowded ITX station: Gapyeong. The attraction is mostly the landscape and that Winter Sonata was filmed there. It’s perfect to visit during the fall with the changing colors of maple and ginkgo trees, however, be prepared to be surrounded with hundreds of other people. There’re regular ferry rides from the wharf to island (5 mins ride). There’s a zip line to get to the island faster too. You can spend 2-3 hours here including a meal. The entire island makes great photography for family and couples. There were so many people waiting for taxi so service back to station could be slow."
"Iconic Korean tourist destination Great place for taking photos is just one of the many attractions (biking, zipline, etc.) offered in Nami island. More restaurants were established since i I was last here (2012)....Still is as charming and enchanting as the first time....and will always be. Best time to come mid to late afternoons to avoid crowds."

A nice place for Nature and picnics.
"The place was crowded even ON a wednesday with locals and Tourist. IT is that popular. You have to take a short ferry ride OF about 5 minutes. The long line makes IT a longer wait. The place have very good scenic places for photo op OF colorful autumn colored trees with some, nicely arranged nito rows. There are statues, some for adults only exhibits. A very good place for picnics and long walks albeit The crowd."
"A must in South Korea Nami island, located in the outskirts of S. Korea is stunning.  It's a must to visit this paradise when you're in Korea.  It's quite far but it's worth the visit.  I can't find the words to describe it and you'll know what I mean when youget  there."
Second and last The island alone is beautiful the food food and reasonable the trip however is plain nacked horror and I do not have enough explicit words nor would TA !allow them happy to have seen it but never agqin Too crowded We purposely booked a trip online to go to Nami island. Indeed it is a very nice little island but it was too crowded. You have to take a ferry to the island and it takes about 3-5 mins to reach. The ferry keep sending people into the island and you can only see people in front of you. But can't complain more because this is the time to see the autumn leaves and we are also one of them...
A must visit to this paradise Nami Island is a paradise in the outskirts of seoul.Was there during the autumn Foliage and being there in person was nothing less of breathtaking views.Avoid the bicycle or electric renting.. Its a ripoff and is absolutely not needed.There are lots of restaurant inside the park and good seating areas.Definitely recommended.
"SOUTH KOREA AUTUMN FOLIAGE An awesome trip to S.Korea, Harry Kim fr. Here Korea Travel is a good tour guide for this trip. He brings us to enjoy many good food. Harry Kim is very knowledgeable and making our trip enjoyable and he has done his job professionally and we know much information from Harry Kim.The best place that i like is Nami Island which is beautiful during autumn, and this is the 1st honeymoon for me n my hubby after marriage 24 years.I will highly recommended Harry Kim fr Here Korea Travel to all my friends who wish to visit South Korea.Thanks to Harry Kim and Here Korea Travel."
Beautiful in autumn One of the must-visit places (at least once) if you’re in South Korea and especially in spring or autumn. We went during autumn - our kids had fun running after squirrels and picking out leaves. So many gorgeous photos to be taken here.
"Gingko Tree Pathway Visited the Nami Republic during the best season of the year ..Autumn.  The changing colors is the main attraction of this place. It was also the location of the K drama  Winter Sonata ? ? (am not a k drama fan so I am not sure if this was the title of the series )A short ferry ride takes one to the island. The other option to get to the island is to take the Zip Wire better known to us as the  Zip Line.   It was a crowded Saturday morning. Tourists and locals are all over the place. As you walk around you enjoy the fresh crisp cool air. You are surrounded by trees which provide the shade for the morning walk.  The gingko trees line the main walkway .. At the time of my visit the leaves  were yellow I was a week or 2 early as I wanted to see them in the orange to red color..  Families have their picnic baskets and enjoy the day by the lake.Food choices in the island are limited to Korean pancakes,  Italian resto, hotdog stand  and coffee houses."
"Autumn Leave Yes. Autumn leave. We plan for the Seoul trip mainly to see autumn leave and Nami Island is the best place for stunning photo and view. The day on our visit no taxi! We have to take bus (normal shuttle bus). No information and only a photo of bus schedule on the bus stop. But, don't worry. I ton of people same as us looking for information. Here you are. Bus number 33-5 is the shuttle bus. Enjoy the view plus sea of people in your photo."
"Worth the long trip from Seoul We came in early autumn so the leaves were changing colors. I guess the sight will be even more beautiful at the height of autumn. The scenery is postcard perfect but there are other amazing sights in the island both man made and natural. There's a ferry going to the island every few minutes and the entrance fee includes the ferry ride. The place is so romantic, many couples come here for their pre-nuptial photos."

"Short stop at Nami Island Visited Nami Island as part of our travel itinerary.  Nami Island is one of the most popular tourist destination of South Korea.  If you like nature, then this is the place for you.  Going to Nami Island, you need to make a short ferry ride.  Ferry schedules are very frequent, (like every 10 minutes) and the ferry can accomodate up to around 70 people (if I'm not mistaken).  The ferry ride was really smooth.Upon arrival, you can see the big signage "" Welcome to Naminara Republic"" and take pictures there.  We were only given 2 hours to roam around so we werent able to go around the whole island.  At least I get to see the place where they usually shoot movies (the long line of cherry trees).  Got to take a picture at the spot where they shot Winter Sonata.  There are many activities at Nami Island like bicycle riding and some kind of small cable car for 2.  There were some squirrels running to and fro and they are so relaxing to watch.  There are also some restaurants and cafes in the Island and I think, they also have a lodge where in you can accomodate.  I think the only problem I see is the lack of clean restrooms.  As usual, there is a long line for the toilet for ladies.Best to come here first thing in the morning, to really enjoy the calm and serenity of the place.  Very good for family bonding and couple date."
Beautiful Island Nice beautiful island especially on a sunny day.  Tall green trees everywhere during summer season.  Peacock wandering freely in the park but please do not feed them with grilled sausages bought there.
Beautiful and peaceful cute nation About an hours drive from city hall seoul. Peaceful and quiet place with beautiful sceneries. There is a row of cafes and restaurants on the island too. There are hotels on the island if you would like to stay for a night or two. Worth a short trip to escape city living for awhile!
"Good daytrip tour from Seoul We took morning train from Seoul station to city near Nami island, then a 10minutes bus to pier and 15 minutes ferry to the island.Island is actually in the middle of river and has lots of activities like biking or just walking around the island with famous avenue for Korean drama Winter Sonata. It has cafe and restaurant in island.For Seoul visitor, Nami island is good option for daytrip tour."
"Nami Island This island is beautiful. Filled with lots of activities: from zip lining, kayaking, biking to simply walking around the island. Famous for Korean dramas."
"Winter at Nami Island Very nice place... especially near photoshoot winter sonata and  the location is friendly for wheelchair. But the food at nami island is very expensive:( Romantic island This small independent Island is famous for being the screen stage in a famous 90s drama movie series.Now as a tourism place, they do very good with many attractive site, funny activities.I quiet enjoy the peaceful park though."
Well done park Really a destination for kids or those desiring a walk along a tree shaded road.Eclectic collection of exhibits mostly attractive to kids.A pleasant walk.Short ferry ride to get there.Great at managing crowds.Food offerings are adequate. Shine shops as well.More for locals than foreigners.Not a bad way to spend an hour if in the area. A bit boring as a destination.
"Nice place Visited here on September 2018, the weather was nice around 18-20 degree.As usual Nami always crowd with foreign and local tourist.We found Nami Island was the good place to sit and enjoy the atmosphere if it’s not too crowd :)We also enjoy when taking the boat from and to Nami IslandThere was a special entrance ticket fee for elderly and afternoon entrance fee after 5PM (if I’m not mistaken) but it’s gonna be dark when arrive to Nami Island :) i can spend whole day chillaxing here!"
"During Korea thanksgiving, i joined a tour to this island. Even with packs of people, i still feel this place is so enjoyable!We rented a double bike and rode around the island, appreciating all the green grass, trees, river, breeze of wind and some animals running around, squirrels, rabbits and birds. There were also performances and artistic corners around.When we left, the ferry queue was very long, but we board very soon, as each ferry departs every 5 mins! Even my stay was very short (as i joined tour), but i really loved this place, and wish to come back again for this beautiful park!"

Must Visit!
"To reach the island, either by zipwire or ferry ride. Island are landscaped with beautiful trees aligned and suitable for anyone at any age to visit. Bikes are available to rent or just walk to enjoy the scenery."
"Average attraction Nami Island is a two-hour travel from Seoul by train. It recently increased its general admission rate from 8,000 won to 13,000 won per person (inclusive of entrance fee and round-trip ferry tickets). We went here on a summer and it looks just like your average park. Probably best to go here during spring or fall. Tip: Save time in exploring this island by renting a bike instead of exploring by foot."
"ONE OF THE HIGHLIGHTS DESTINATION IN SOKOR The place is quite far from Seoul, and it will take around 5hours of travel if its traffic...The island is famous because of winter sonata and other movies...It is worth the visit if you are a picture addict...Honestly, what i could only remember to this place is their trees and winter sonata cast statue..."
Worth visiting just for the flying fox!
"A nice little island, but to be honest not much to do here. Restaurant in the middle is pleasant for lunch. By far the best thing here is the awesome trip from the mainland to the island by flying fox! Don't miss it, but not for those afraid of heights! Take the ferry instead. But for those brace enough, fantastic!"
"Nami Island Went to visit Nami Island as part of the tour. It's the set for Winter Sonata (Korean drama). Found out they are their own ""Republic"" with its own hotel, bank, post office, restaurants, gift stores, etc on d the island. Kinda reminded me of the Vatican in Italy. It will say immigration where you buy your tickets but anyone can go in. It's really neat. Walk along the tree lined path, rent a bike, explore or play on the lake. You can stay the night or just make a day trip out of it. Think of it as a mini resort. Family oriented for sure and for couples too.From what I understand its under 2 hours from Seoul. You will ride a 5min ferry ride to reach the island. Nami is now on my bucket list for next time destination (planning to stay the night)."
Nice place to visit!
"Went here via Bus then dropped us at someplace sorry I forgot. Then continued our trip with boat to get to the Island. I didnt buy tickets because it was included in my bus tickets, sorry I forgot the name and where to but them.At first I just walking around the area then I found out that the renting a bike! So me and my friend we rent a tandem bike for two! It was so fun, to stroll around the island using bike! We can stop whenever we like and take photos. Such a nice experience!"
"Picturesque It is a good place to have a picnic. There are tall, beautiful metasequoia trees that make it a good spot for photos. The best time to visit is in Autumn when the leaves have turned yellow and orange. Very beautiful. This is the shooting location of the well-known K-drama Winter Sonata. There is a statue of the two protagonists to commemorate this show. You can rent a bike and enjoy the whole island. You can reach the island either by ferry or zipline. There are some restaurants in the island."
K drama setting For those avid in K dramas this is an interesting place to go. Much better to come here in spring or winter though. it has been named after a controversial General who was buried in that island. but i think nobody cares about that people just passes his grave. from the parking you can take the ferry to cross the river going to the island or take it more extreme and take the zipline. a lot of trees and small parks. Food is much cheaper inside the island contrast to advise of the tour guide that its much cheaper outside. You can appreciate nature there but nothing extra expectacular.
"Korean dramas came to life Being a KDrama fan myself, this place is like paradise to my eyes and to my heart. And so when me and my cousins (Kdrama fan also) visited this place back in Nov 2012, it was a dream come true! So may insta-worthy spots to take pictures with and so many drama scenes to reminisce about. This is just heaven for us. The food here was also good. One bad thing about it (well not that it’s really bad) is that there are so many tourists, so manu literally flocking everywhere. Well it only showes that this is very popular to so manu people, even for those not kdrama fans, I think. And because of this visit, I personally loved autumn over any other seasons those colors I seen there were so unreal that my eyes were in feast. I would definitely go back here when I get the chance to visit South Korea again."
Loved it!
"This is a beautiful and must visit place. We strolled along the full circumference of the island and it was beautiful. Lots of tiny walkways, cosy seating areas and awesome views. We reached at noon and stayed for 4 hours and were able to cover the full island easily. We didn't do any activities though. The weather was great when we visited 3 days back and I am sure this area will be even more spectacular during the fall season."

"great place to visit it is a wonderful vacation i have ever experienced since ever. the island is small wonderful and beautiful scene with trees suit for photos. we were happy and had a nice photos finally to show in our facebook. we spent one night there and the resort was excellent with traditional with a Korean typical. the room so clean, no dust even we could touch. the pick up car was on time as well as the ferry.i would recommend nami island to you all to visit."
Nice view and lots of insta-worthy backgrounds Went there early winter last year.  The weather was very cold but the scenery was very nice. Nami Island is a muslim -friendly tourist attraction as there are comfortable prayer rooms provided. Do not forget to try the delish pancakes!
"Romantic and peaceful My family and I spent an enjoyable 3 hours on a hot weekday afternoon at Nami (Namiseon) Island, which was formed as a result of the construction of Cheongpyeong Dam and was named after General Nami.Getting there:We took a taxi from the main road next to Gapyeong Rail Park and reached the ferry terminal with a taxi fare of ₩5300. We took a bus back to Myeong-dong that left (daily) the ferry terminal at 5pm, which contradicts the 4pm departure time stated in the brochure. The bus is behind the ticket booth and it reached Myeong-dong at around 6:30pm. Besides the Myeong-dong bus, there are direct shuttle bus to and fro Nami Island ferry terminal from Insa-dong (9:30am), Namdaemun (9:30am), Myeong-dong (9:45am). You have to check the departure time from Nami Island Ferry Terminal bus park with the ticket counter.Depending on the time of the day, the ferry departs every 20 to 30 minutes. The “visa fee” (entrance fee) is ₩13,000 for adults (₩10,000 entry fee and ₩3,000 ferry fare), ₩10,000 for students (13-17 years old) and seniors and ₩7,000 for children. However, we paid ₩10,000 each because the ferry fare was free from January to June 2018. Besides the ferry, you could opt to take the zipwire one way into Nami Island (₩38,000, includes entry fee and return ferry fare)The attraction:The “Naminara Republic” brochure mentions “Today Nami Island is a place for rest and relaxation. Human beings, animals and trees share peace, love and harmony far away from crowds and civilisation.” I agree that the “crowds and civilisation” refers to Seoul and mainland Korean peninsula. But every time the ferry berths, crowds of tourists swarmed the island, hence it is never far away from crowds! You have to be patient and wait for the crowd to walk on and disperse before you could have that private moments and fantastic photos with the rows of trees at the Central Korean Pine Tree Lane, Cherry Tree Lane, Gingko Tree Lane and Metasequoia Lane. The trees are so tall that these could reach the sky but more importantly, they offer cooling shade from the sun. At the Metasequoia Lane, don’t miss the brown statues of the two lead actors of the Korean hit drama Winter Sonata (which was shot here) - Yong-joon Bae and Ji-wo Choi, and a bench with the picture of these two Korean actors as the backdrop.Besides the above Tree Lanes, we enjoyed the Nature walk at other parts of the Nami Island. When the weather became unbearably hot, we took refuge at the Book Café and ate bingsu. You could rent bicycles if you don’t want to walk.My next visit to Nami Island would be during the autumn or where I will stay the night in the bungalows (₩160,000 – 380,000) or cottages (₩119,000-149,000) where we can experience the “rest and relaxation” the next morning and “far away from crowds”.Overall, Nami Island amazed me in that it is well maintained since its opening in 1965. Don’t miss his attraction when you are in Seoul…even though you are not a fan of the romantic Korean drama!"
Awesome Island I am almost lost for words in describing this beautiful island. Nami Island is a gem of South Korea and a must visit attraction. Every season of the year offers a different character and feel in the Island. I loved everything about it and getting lost is certainly an adventure!
"Gorgeous Island Nami Island is a stunningly beautiful place which is reachable from Seoul via subway. The nearest station is Gapyeong, from where the Gapyeong City Bus can be boarded. A day pass purchased in the bus allows one to hop on and off the bus any number of times in a day and travel to other nearby attractions such as Petite France and The Garden of Morning Calm.The ferry ride to the island takes about 10 minutes. On entering the island, one can enjoy the performance by a band, the never-ending lane of tall majestic trees, traditional Korean food, photo opportunity with ostriches, and much more."
"Love this place Went here during summer. It was hot but there's plenty of shade from the trees to go under. Place is very picturesque so you're sure to make wonderful shots here. A whole day is needed to go around the place and relax. There are boat activities here so check them out when you'r there. There are also restaurants and coffee shops around the place so you don't have to worry about getting thirsty or hungry. Again, this is a really nice place and it's a must-visit if you're in Korea."
"Beautiful Island Nami Island is one of the places that must be visited if you are in Seoul. The island is always filled with tourists from abroad in any season. To get to the island is actually not too expensive, of Seoul metro subway ride to Yongsan Train Station and then ride ITX and continued to Gapyeong Gapyeong tour bus ride to Nami Island. To get to Nami Island, you have to take a ferry for about 2 minutesArriving there the atmosphere of shady trees will welcome you with a breeze. The thing to visit is the winter sonata filming place and there are several other places that are quite interesting. Recommendations to the island should be in the spring or winter so you will get very good photos Nami Island & Petite France Tour We highly recommended a private tour to this place as it is located outside the city. It is a nice place to see and take pictures with family. Our tour guide was excellent and helpful. Tranport and food were good too."
Beautiful ❤️ Please have a visit here. it's quite pricey for the ticket but it is affordable bout 14000 won. Enjoying the scenery.

"Pretty island that is worth visiting We visited this place as part of a tour during lunch time and we totally enjoyed the time here. As someone from Singapore, am also totally surprised by the presence of a Merlion here.Even though you may not be a Winter Sonata fan (the island is popular because of this), Nami Island is still very pretty and relaxing. You will need to take a ferry to reach the island (or you can zipline in if you're feeling adventurous for around 30,000+ won), and there are a lot of different facilities on the island aside from all the pretty nature spots.There are cafes, museums, restaurants and even a hotel on the island for those who want to spend the night.Love the scenery here, the line of trees on the side of the path is really iconic and place is definitely romantic. You can also get good water views and you can also do water sports if you want to, for a fee of course. Highly recommend to visit the place during autumn or spring as the place will be more beautiful. You can easily spend up to a day here if you want to complete all the activities.I was okay with just the 3 hours that we spend here, as it was enough to sample what the island has to offer. There are also eateries before you board the ferry to the island and water sports all around.Loved the place and recommend visiting as part of a tour."
"Beautiful island of nature Get away from the busy city of Seoul by taking a short trip out to Nami Island! Just an hour’s drive or so out from the main city, take a ferry to the independent island which seems to be a nature reserve all on its own. Plenty of tall and beautiful trees of varying types that give an awesome landscape and backdrop for pictures, especially in the autumn or winter seasons as well as animals like ostriches, peacocks, rabbits and squirrels to be sighted all around."
Well worth a visit!
"Great walks, beautiful sights, lots of photo opportunities, nice ice-cream cone vendors, numerous restaurants to choose from, a wide variety of drinks (including beer, wine and coffee) available, fun ferry crossing, information boards everywhere, bunny rabbits hopping around everywhere, lovely gift shops dotted around the island, an NSPCC train, games for kids, water sports and a zipline available if you have time. No end to the fun, highly recommend this place!"
"Korea trip 2018 Anyongaseo the wonderful day of nami island south of Korea. You can not be happy with this place if you come alone so you must bring your girlfriend or boyfriend Memorable experience It was a very memorable experience for us to visit this man made island.  Everything was very organised, even including the ferry ride to/from the island.The island has got many beautiful landscapes.  Even though many of the places were man made, they looked very natural.We rented bikes to go around the island and it was a very enjoyable experience."
"Worth a visit to Nami Island This artificial island is famous because of korean drama ""Winter Sonata"". Really enjoyed walk into woods, take nice photos and yummy dakgalbi."
A great day trip!
"Namisum is a tiny half-moon shaped island located in Chuncheon, South Korea, formed as it was inundated by the rising water of the North Han River as the result of the construction of Cheongpyeong Dam (청평댐) in 1944. Its name originated from General Nami (남이장군), who died at the age of 28 after being falsely accused of treason during the reign of King Sejo, the seventh king of the Joseon Dynasty of Korea. Although his grave was not discovered, there were a pile of stones where his body was supposed to be buried. It was believed that if someone took even one stone from there, it would bring misfortune to their house. A tour company arranged the grave with soil and then developed Namisum into an amusement park.I visited Nami Island with a friend and we took a ferry across to it - although a Zip Line is optional for a higher fee.Nami Island has restaurants with very good Korean food: BBQ and hot pot style...There is a Jittney to drive you around for a small fee so you can see the  perimeter of the Island.There is a small Ostrich farm.There are even guest houses available to rent.It's a very nice day trip and worth going to. Very similar to West Lake in Hang Zhou Province, China, but definitely larger."
"awesome island nami island, as they say is a republic on its own, it has everything from own hotels, restaurants, water sports, nature trip even having its own Cetral bank for currency exchange. a day is not enough though to explore this awesome place Zip Wire I believe the ferry costs W7,000. If you're more adventurous and want to see beautiful views, take the zip line over the Han River, which was about W40,000. That includes zipline and admission to Nami Island. The adventure zip line is faster and takes you across to a different island, then you will still take a ferry to nami Island. The Family zip line is longer and slower, but takes you straight to Nami Island.Nami island is full of beautiful views and things to look at. There's a few restaurants to choose from. Looks like a great place for kids with a lot of activities. I can't wait to go back in the fall."

Worth a visit Its an hour and a half to reach Nami Island from Seoul. Its gets longer if traffic is bad. You go for a 3 minute ferry ride to reach the island. Its quite artistic and its a nice place to spend your day. I would add this to one of the things to do when visiting south Korea.
"Island retreat Visited here playing music as a tourist, really impressed with the energy in the island and the level of detail and quality of the landscape, ornaments, restaurants. The design at each turn is apparent, aimed at working in harmony with humans to invoke relaxation and harmony. It is a bit touristy ...probably.... but as a tourist, I loved it!"
I'll love to see it on fall season.
"I went to Nami Island on early April, I guess it was not the best time to go there if you look for the beautiful trees. I recommend you to go on fall season, which is around October or November.Other than that, the place is actually nice, they have bike rent for us to go around the island. They also have zip wire to go to the island if you feel taking a boat to go across the island is a bit boring.There's a lot food choices with variety of prices and also a convenience store on the island.I will try to go back on fall."
"A day full of joy💟 Nami island was really an interestingexperience for us...Our visit to Nami island was full of joy; we had a blast riding zip wire ...as we went through the nature side,saw artistically organized worth visiting places in the island such as a kids library, a nice Asian style restaurant,souvenir stores."
"too touristy nami is a must visit place in korea. the island become popular after the k-drama winter sonata hit the tv show around the world. it is a nice and small island but too many tourist in a day make it crowd and the beauty fade away. the other problem is when to get back to main land, i need to queue for a loooong q. for muslim, there is a halal restaurant in the island and they also make a prayer room. a good effort from the local management sice the island is really famous among muslim from SEA."
"Petite France and Nami Island Tour We took a guided tour from Seoul to Petite France then to Nami Island on May 29, 2018.  We booked it online about 2 weeks prior on KLOOK.  It was just under $50 USD per person and only included transportation and some minimal talking from the tour guide.  We were picked up by bus from Myeongdong Station Exit 2 in the morning and returned by night.  It was a fun day trip though we felt Nami Island was the better attraction because there were more things to do than Petite France, which is more just for photographs.  Nami Island is really a park accessible by boat or zipline -- but you can't carry your bags on the zipline.  There are food stalls, cafes, and bike rentals on the island which is really pretty for picture taking."
"Winter Sonata Those who watched the Winter Sonata will see this place before, alot ot good view, we took a vehicle to go around the island for KR7000 20 minutes ride it should be very fun, but… unfortunately I came here on national children day, very crowded and lots of queues. Even the queue is very long from the harbour to cross the river.Nami island itself was beautiful. Everywhere we looked there were rows and rows of trees. Although it was quite sunny, the trees provided shade in most places on the island.You can spend 2 to 3 hours walking around the island, the scenery is very nice. this island is very famous for winter sonata filming location, one of the most popular korean drama (actually i have never watched).A lot of good spot to take pictures, if you lucky can see the local animals like rabbits and squirrels. Love to be back in autumn peak season. it should be Great."
Nami island Maybe nami island is beautiful in winter. Summer here is nothing special. Will come again when fall or winter.

"wonderful island I been here for summer and all those leaves are different color. I love everything here, all Korean couple are so cute and they were wear the same clothes. all the area are clean ever a lot of people."
"Must visit Make sure you visit this place at least once.It is a mini secluded island in the middle of Korean Peninsula.I suggest you book a tour service online before your visit (e.g. Klook). To avoid crowds, visit at the earliest time (9 AM-ish) as you still need to take a boat there. We took the path contrary to the suggested pathway so we were able to take in the scenery without crowds at all.The middle of the island is the most crowded especially the Winter Sonata photo spots.You don't need a long time to circle the island, only around 2 hours, or 3 if you want to visit the museums as well."
"WINTER SONATA Most famous Korean movie ,  Winter Sonata was filmed here.Its a must to visit for winter sonata fans. The island exectly same as you watching the drama..and Just get ready your camera because Nami is peaceful island with its breathtaking view."
"UNICEF family Friendly Island Nami island is a must visit for all holiday makers in Seoul. It is the island of Korean Film making industry. You will be transported to the main island through 10 minutes Ferryboatride.   The island itself is small but beautiful. The main walking way is lined with Pine trees. It is usually sunny, so make sure you have your hat and sunglasses with a bottle of water. Our tour guide recommended a traditional lunch at Nammoon (Authentic Korean restaurant). We had a great, healthy and tasty lunch.   I am not very sure about the name of the dishes, see photos for illustration. You can stay at the island for a few days in one of the hotels for rest and relaxation.SEE photos."
"Zipline to Nami Island with secret photo spots It costs ₩38000 per person, including the zipline, private boat to Nami Island and way back ferry. I expected taking Zipline to the main island of Nami. In fact, you have to take a boat transfer to the Nami Island. They have two courses: 30-40km/ for family and 80km/ for adventure.**reservation is not required if you visit Nami Island during summer. The waiting time is short too:)There are many secret photo spots here and I think it is even prettier than the main Nami Island.We have waited for 10 mins for the short boat trip, which takes around 8 minutes. There are only 10 ppl in the boat and luxury compared to the ferry, which can carry 100+ people."
"Not worth in Summer I don’t know. I just thought it’s too much a hassle to travel to Nami in summer. Not that I’ve been during other seasons. But Nami in summer is not ideal. Firstly, the weather is a killer. Super hot. Secondly, there wasn’t much to see. The cafes here and there were nice but not easy to find tables as many people would like to find shelter to hide away from the sun too. Thirdly, too crowded. There were not just tourists but also Koreans.One can choose to either take the ferry or zip line to get to Nami Island when you reached the ferry terminal. The ferry is just a 5min ride.We got onto a coach for a one day tour to Petite France and then Nami Island. Fyi, the coach ride for the last 15 min to Petite France made some feeling nauseous as the road was quite winding. Quite certain even if the tour were to go Nami Island first, would be the same."
Short day tour to Nami island Taking coach to ferry terminal for a 5 min transfer to the island was easy. The island look small but walking from one end to the other takes about 45 mins. Took a non-stop tour train cost ys 7000 KW was a good choice so at least we know where are the places we need to explore later. It will be nicer to go in winter to take the stretch of trees where the Korean tv series Winter Sonata was filmed.A trip worth going!
"Best Place to Get Away from the City Learn from our mistake: Don't forget to tap out your Seoul T-money card from Yongsan station when you are about to transfer to an ITX train going to Gapyeong.You can purchase your ticket from the station (if you want a reserved seat) or you may also buy your tickets on-board if you don't mind standing. The conductors during our trip were kind enough and knew basic English so it was not much of a trouble for us.Spend your entire day to Nami Island for a picnic. There's no corkage fee if you bring your own meals, although food sold inside the resort were not too expensive as well. You may opt to skip Petit France. :)Instead of paying for an unlimited bus ride for a day, just ride a local bus to Nami and back. We paid for an unli bus ride and we had a not so pleasing experience with it. The bus from Nami to Petit France was full so we had to stand during the entire ride (it felt like almost an hour ride to the next destination). We got dizzy, thus we did not enjoy Petit France as much as we have to."
Flying Zipline to Nami Island We have good experience taking the Zipline to Nami Island during winter time.  Nice scenery from high.
"One of my Faves Been here spring and autumn twice, this year for summer. Hope next time winter season.Its pretty and very picturesque. Love the trees.Go on weekdays, early morning for less crowd."

The most beautiful scenic island in south korea When I boarded the tour ferry I felt the wind blowing at my face when I was looking at the island view and it was very magnificent and beautiful.
"Try the Zipline You can choose to go Nami Island by Zipline or ferry. We took zipline and it was fun. Family pass can be bought online to skip the queue. It includes 1 x bus trip, 1 x train ride, Cycling and treego at a package price. Island is relatively small, landscaping was a little disappointing. Suitable for family with kids as there’s activities eg treego."
"Naminara Republic Spent my birthday in Nami Island. It was magical. Although the place was dotted with people, I still enjoyed the beautiful garden, tree-lined walkways, the river-view, the art work display, the children's book corner.The korean restaurant in the island also served delectable food (dak galbi) although it is a bit pricey.Wiuld like to return to this beautiful place."
"Something to check off list People are speaking highly of this place. I would recomend it if you have a special someone, you want to have relive romantic moments from a korea-novela. If you're a solo traveler, avoid this if couples being sweet to eaxh other irritate you.But you can come if you have family or friends with you."
"Nature scenery Namiseom or more popular as Nami island is a well known island in South Korea. Filming location for the most famous korean drama “Winter Sonata “ We took the ferry to reach the island or you pay more and go by Zip line. Ferry ride was just 5 – 6 minutes. Half moon shape is a unique feature to this islandAttractive landscapes with no telephone poles gives a natural feeling. Tree lined walkways are amazing. Few of them are Pine, Ginko , Matasequoin, Cherry and many more . Cute little kimchi huts adds a different beauty to the island.Bunnies and squirrels roam around freely. Unfortunately Water garden swimming pool wasn’t operating. Plenty of photo-ops. Winter sonata statue and Mermaid statue are the two popular statues. Saw two ostriches fighting with each other.Opens from 7.30am to 9.45pm.Villas and bungalows are available to stay on this island.In spite of many tourists and locals , we had great time walking around."
Very picturesque We were there during the winter season and it was extremely cold. Need to take a boat ride to reach the island. It was very scenic and romantic especially along the neat rows of trees.
"Romantic island For me the best time to visit is during autumn/sping - afternoon 3:30-4pm just before sunset. Once you arrive, don't linger near the ferry wharf, go straight to the farthest point - Gingko Tree Lane/Metasequoia Lane and walk your way back to the ferry wharf. Metasequoia lane would be best around 4pm just when the sunlight is at the right angle. The lighting would be so nice. Other than this visitor can have a relax time watching the trees and enjoying the clean air. There is a famous pancake there, sweet but not that sweet..very nice...."
"Good scenery but so hot We went there early of June, was pretty hot, but we really enjoyed the trip.. will go there again next time during autumn or winter! 😉 Interesting experience A very picturesque island it was fun to travel on the boat packed out with locals and to see them all enjoying their day out. Several choices for lunch and coffee and many photo opportunities. Not really the place for a solo visit as you feel lonely among the crowds."
"Only for fans of K drama 'Winter Sonata' Nami Island is popular among Koreans as an outdoor vacation spot, but so are Jeju many other places on the Korean Peninsula. It is scenic in autumn when the foliage turns into vibrant hues of yellow, orange and green, but imho not worth a detour in the hot summer months. Indeed day tours to Nami Island are packaged together with two other places viz Garden of Morning Calm and Petit France for a more substantive day trip out of Seoul.Visit the Nami Island Tourist Info Centre in Insadong for help to plan your itinerary. The easiest and most economical way is to take the Nami Island shuttle from Insadong; spend the night before your day trip in Insadong. If you plan to join a Nami Island day tour (semi guided), I recommend spending the night before your visit at Prince Hotel in Myeongdong, as the tour pick up point is at the open space in front of The North Face Store right beside this hotel. Wear comfy shoes and use sunblock liberally as the summer sun's rays can be scorching in the afternoons."

"Picturesque Nami Island We took the 7 am ITX train from Yongsan and arrived Gapyeong Station at 8 am. Took a taxi to the wharf costing 4000 Won as the public bus won't arrive till more than 45 minutes later.Taking the ferry across was just 5 minutes. The rest of the time was spent at this fabulous island made famous by the Kdrama Winter Sonata.The island was really lovely with plenty of picture opportunities. It wasn't very crowded when we were there. There are some restaurants and shops on the island.By the time we left the island after 10 am, ferry loads of tourists were arriving. We were glad we came very early to avoid the crowd. Nami Island is touristy but a really nice place to visit even if you are not a fan of Winter Sonata.There are many restaurants at the wharf area and other water activities nearby including bungee jumping. Don't worry about going hungry here."
"Iconic Island A great island to visit, if you love nature this is the island to visit, great for family picnic and photo taking."
Second time visiting!
"It’s my second time visiting Nami Island and it was just another ‘walk in the park’. It is a tourist spot with beautiful scenery for all seasons. There’s nothing much to this place if you’re a camera shy person because this place is meant for photo taking sessions. It’s pretty far off from seoul city centre, only visit if you really like what you see on photos!"
"Memories It was the Korean series Winter Sonata that made me dreamt of visiting Nami Island. It was the most unexplainable nostalgic moment I’ve been as a tourist. Only a fan would understand. Nevertheless, everyone would enjoy the beautiful sceneries especially at this time of the year and relax in an atmosphere filled with romance."
"Really good place to visit Honestly, I never expected this place to be so nice. It turned out to become one of the highlights of our South Korea family trip. My kids enjoyed the short boat ride and the activities on the island. Would you believe they even have some ostriches there! I think you will love the place even if you're not a big fan of the show, Winter Sonata. There are lots of food stalls and restaurants around the island and tried to eat as much food as we could! Will definitely go back to visit Nami Island again someday."
"Enjoyable Nice island to visit in April, we missed the cherry blossom, but its still a nice scenic visit and very enjoyable."
Peaceful island! Great for photos!
"It’s a nice trip if you like nature, trees and love taking OOTDs. A lot of Korean couples come here for dates.It’s a 1 hr or so bus ride from Myeong-Dong and a 5 mins ferry that comes every 30 minutes. There was WiFi on the bus! I went during summer. It was abit hot and my family picked a nice picnic bench to eat our Gimbaps we bought from the underground shopping area at the shinsegae underpass. As the food on the island is more expensive and not as nice, even my Korean friends told me to eat before going to Nami IslandOn 28th May when I visited, the maple garden was so picturesque !"
"Green Trees for Summer I think it is better if you book a tour going to Nami Island, just so the transportation is easier. From Myeongdong it was like an hour and roughly 30 mins to go to Nami Island via Bus. There are restaurants in and out of Nami Island, so if you are going to have lunch there it would be fine. After having our lunch outside Nami Island we already went to the Ferry Boat (around 10mins). And voila! Welcome to Nami Island itself.We went there during summer season so the trees were green. There were also quite a number of people, but I still managed to take a good shot. I suggest you go here on weekdays because I’ve heard there are more people on weekends.There are a lot of activities in Nami Island, you could even ride a vehicle for 7,000won for a 20minute tour (or view because the driver didn’t really speak English) for the whole place. You could also rent a bike, because let’s face it, it is tiring to go walk around (since it’s pretty big too)This place has a lot of kids playing around, so this is good if you got Kids with you.Overall, I would love to visit Nami again. Better make sure to check it out when you visit Seoul Photogenic place Nami Island is a very picturesque place and the location for many Korean dramas. To go there you will have to take a 5 minute ferry ride. The ferry ride is very smooth and uneventful, you won't even notice it moving. For the more adventurous, you can even zipline your way to the island.There are a lot of photogenic spots and secret nooks which you can just pass away the time. Lots of restaurants, shops and entertainment to keep you from getting bored. If it's not raining, best to rent a bike and enjoy the scenery. There's even a little train for the kids."
"Go for the scenery People recommending this place to go as a ""beautiful place you never seen before"" and I have to admit it is true. However, it is pretty far from downtown Seoul (around 1-2 hours ride) and if you're traveling with small children without a tour bus (or renting a car) I don't think it's worth the hassle. Even though there are so many attractions for children, especially the picture book library beyond the cafes, and many many photo spots designed for families. Another thing, this island is famous for it's Winter Sonata monuments. If you're a fan of Winter Sonata or K-Drama in general, do not miss this spot. Overall, I think it's a nice place to visit, and if you're bringing a travel photographer, you'll have an unforgettable photo album."

"Winter sonata Beautiful island. Not far from Seoul. One day trip to this place is enough. Must visit place in Korea if you korea drama lovers hehe Lovely island Nami Island is always on my itinerary whenever I visit S. Korea. It is a very beautiful place, with cherry blossoms in early April and red maple leaves (as well as golden ginkgo leaves) in autumn. If you look around carefully you can find squirrels. A great place for photography."
"Beautiful Island Nami Island is a beautiful island with cinematic sceneries, a just setting for the korean tv series winter sonata, that set a trend for korean tv series worldwide. The island is well kept and has different animals co habiting with nature. If planning to go there, set it in the early morning to fully explore the entire island, and wear comfortable shoes for walking."
"Felt Like A Dream I've read so many things about Nami Island and how it would be amazing to go there on a day trip. But when I got there I just felt like I was dreaming. It really was so lovely to walk around the island. Very relaxing to just go around and explore the area as it really is so beautiful. If you're into photography, you would love this place so many amazing views and spots."
One Day Adventure!
"When we visited Nami Island, we scheduled it for the whole day because we did not know what to specifically do there. We actually planned to go to Petit France and Garden of the Morning Calm, but that did not happen. We just stayed in the island from 10AM to 3PM and we enjoyed! If you are like us who enjoy sightseeing, taking pictures (tons of them), biking and eating, then Nami Island will truly be an adventure. There are a lot of tourists. I mean it. You need to be first in every picture-worthy spot or wait paitiently for your turn to take pictures. We enjoyed biking the whole island. It was seriously nice! The spots at each end of the island is a little different but it gives the same calming vibe. Enjoy taking videos!"
Just beautiful !
"For Korean film lovers, this is a romantic place to visit. We were here in April and the weather was really cool. A short ferry will find us on the main river island. Should rent a bike to explore and have an ice cream.Selfie and capture all sweet moments Kdrama feels!!"
"Nami island is always in the list for Korea trip. This place is very relaxing and very cold. There's so many instagramable spot here. Of course as a Kdrama fan, statue of Winter Sonata and Tree lined path is a must.There's so many restaurant to choose in the island and even before riding a ferry going to Nami."
Nami island 😍 The best thing i have visit nami island and i want to come again. The island is very very beautifull i don't know what to say and i never want to forget it.
"Raining My daughter and I came around first week of June and the weather is so unpredictable, the other day it's raining and the next day It's so hot and sunny. But we still enjoy Nami Island. Hoping to see it covered with snow next visit Family Retreat went to this place called Namimara Republic. a wonderful ferry trip to the island. plenty to see and very good place for family, couple and everyone. the management very thoughtful and considerated to the visitor."

"a beautiful island with beautiful maple trees We joined a local tour to get there on 30 April.  There were many locals and oversea tourists visiting this island.  It was clean, beautiful and well-maintained.  Many beautiful trees and flowers were planted there.  It was also a right season to visit there as we could see a lot of nice flowers with colorful maple trees. There were coffee shops and restaurants on the island too.  You can easily spend a few hours to relax yourselves, with a cup of coffee or ice cream.  It is a must-see island from Seoul."
Beautiful place!
"Nami Island is a beautiful and relax place to visit! With the nice cooling weather in spring, you can have a cup of hot drink and enjoy reading there."
"Comfort to sleep Good and comfy to sleep at Nami island.In the winter it’s nice weather. A bit dust if your nose is too close, beware.Enjoy!"
Spring Sonata ...
"Finally visited Nami Island on my 2nd trip to South Korea. I have heard alot about this island from friends donkey years ago before Winter Sonata aired on TV. After the drama, it makes me wanted to visit this place very badly. A small but beautiful island who no residents, purely an attraction of Chuncheon. There is a resort on the island and some restaurants though. There is the Unicef theme park on the island too. We chose the right time to visit as it is not over crowded. Love the rows of straight trees which is the main attraction. A good place to take OOTD pictures though. We also seen couples re-enacting some scenes of the Winter Sonata! Lol We took the bus trail ride that covered the coastline of the island. Breath-taking scenery and locals jogged or strolled along the coastline enjoying the view. An island not to be missed if you are in Chuncheon."
"Sights and food Stopped by as part of a day tour from Seoul. The tour already included the boat ride to the island. There was an option of zip lining into the island but when I went there was a 2-hour wait so didn't go ahead with it. We were also given maps of the island which was really useful in getting around.The island itself is amazing. Plenty of things to see as you walk around the island. We were there during the winter so they had quite a few ice sculptures around. There were a few water features but they were mostly covered in ice. Interestingly they had ostriches as well. We just had to be careful since the ground was also covered in ice and snow so it was quite slippery.Aside from the sights, there were also plenty of food places around including the snowman hotteok, which was a delicious crispy pancake filled with sugar.A really nice place for a day trip. Even though there were plenty of people we found a few places which were a bit more serene."
"Wonderful We book a tour in going for easy transport and entrance. It was raining and cold but still manage to get a glimpse of the island. Coffee shops and resto were around. Its hard to take photo on the ginko trees and other spot since a lot of people wanted to take photo also. Its a good place to visit and photo taking Nami Island at winter Visit this place last January 2017. Half of the place was covered in snow, nice to eat sausage or corn while walking or you can rent a bike while strolling the island in a cold and breezy weather. A must to go place while in Korea! will try to visit this place in other season."
Great place for nature lovers!
"This was our first visit to Seoul and there was no way we could have come back without visiting Nami Island. We reached there early around 0930am after 1.5 hours drive from Seoul and spent ~3 hours exploring the place. It does get crowded later in the day and its hard to get your desired photo without someone getting into your frame. There are different tree lanes of Korean Pine tree, Gingko trees, metasequoia and cherry trees offering picture perfect backdrops. Needless to say there are enough spots for the K-drama fans of Winter Sonata. I was pleasantly surprised to find ostriches and peacocks in this place besides others like large squirrels! Spent a good time exploring several souvenir shops. If you like something especially the Nami Island snowmen souvenirs, buy them here as we didn't find them in Seoul.Even though I am personally a big fan of bright red and orange hues of autumn, but our visit during the spring time was equally beautiful! This is a nature lovers delight and I guess any season is worth a visit. Besides, the road journey from Seoul passes through the beautiful countryside with mountains and river, which is a bonus. Overall we thoroughly enjoyed the day outing. Definitely recommended."
Feels!
"To be honest there is nothing much to do in Nami, just taking photos. While every spot is intagrammable, that's basically what's in there. Well if you are a fan of Winter Sonata, it's a must, there's their sculpted figures in there. It would take hour/s for you to roam the area. Nonetheless, it is said your Korea trip won't be complete with Nami, and I also do believe too though, it just give you the feels of all those you've seen in dramas."
Surprisingly authentic korean dishes Had lunch with my family on nami island and was surprised by their tasty korean dishes. Ordered the beef bulgogi stew served with leafy vege and boiled glutinous rice with beans and red dates wrapped in lotus leaves. Another dish was the crispy seafood pancake and lastly we asked for the acorn jelly salad. The serving was big and enough to fill 5 of us. Didn’t expect such a good traditional korean restuarant on nami island.

"Pretty but very busy Our trip to Nami Island was very enjoyable.  Especially if you walk around the outside of the island, which not many people do.  However if you try and walk through some of the main paths, it is chaotically busy (and we went mid week)I’m glad I’ve been, but I don’t feel the need to rush back."
Enchanting!
"This is one of the best place I visited when we were in Korea. The trees, landscape and weather are perfect for strolling. My wife and I rented a biked to see the whole island. There are several site attraction and photo spot in this island. I highly recommend renting a bike to go around this island. The island is quite huge and if you are only on day your, i suggest to go early morning and spend 1 entire day in this island.Will definitely visit this place again and try to stay overnight."
trees i can called this as a romantic place. and very nice to visit with family. you must take ferry to go here. wonderful place with a lot of trees make this place to take photo. they also have souvenir shop for tourist who came here. i very recommend this place when you come to south korea. also i recommend you to come at winter season.
Beautiful Been here during the winter and again during the spring.  Both times I enjoyed walking through and taking pictures of the various nature sites and exhibits. The tree lines paths are beautiful.  You can arrive here via ferry or the zip line!
place is a nice visit for a picnic..
"nice place for a family picnic..go by ferry or zipline..as there was a long queue for zip line, i went by the ferry and it was a good visit. line of trees, statues and much for the fans of winter sonata..took a bicycle for 30 min and it was fun driving the bike and looking for the spots..overall a fine place for outing.."
"If you go to Seoul and decided to skip this, you are missing out."
The best place for families in my opinion. My toddler enjoyed running around chasing the squirrels and rabbits here. it was so picture perfect! Do note that the hotteok there was overrated. Can be skipped in my honest opinion. The dakgalbi before heading to the wharf was good though!
"ONLY for die-hard fans of winter sonata The amount of money you pay to get to and enter this place is NOT worth it. If you want to see trees, there are other free parks in Seoul which are just as,if not more beautiful. Granted, the place is not ugly. But let me repeat, the TIME AND MONEY spent to get here is NOT WORTH IT. Wont even bother to write about the food and activities available at the island. It's just not worth it."
Good place to visit The scene is nice and the place is pretty big! A great place for photo and relax walking. My kid enjoy running at spacious ground.
Tourist trap Very very overrated and expensive to travel to. Attractions were very little and you see rows of trees and some little houses. Unless you are a die hard fan of winter sonata.... Otherwise this place is just another park and any other free park would be nicer and more centrally located.
"Refreshing afternoon walking Nami island is a must visit when you come to South Korea, it's had its own history, beside the popular k-drama shooting. The view will be amazing in spring and autumn. A must experience, you can enjoy the island using rail bike or just walking slowly while enjoying the fresh air and the view."

Nami Island adventure Our family had a fantastic holy week vacation in Seoul South Korea this last holy week.we visited Nami Island and we enjoyed out stay there. We had a lot of photos taken.we did a lot of walking..sad to say we only have limited time to explore the island because we have other places to visit..the place is great.
"Great way to spend the day My friend and I arrived at the quay and decided to do zip lining- which was great fun and well worth it! We then got the ferry to nami Island which is beautiful and has plenty to see. We walked around admiring the trees and the natural beautiful. We also hired a bike for 30 minutes which is a great way to see the island. Plenty of food and drink plus some great photo opportunities. I really enjoyed my time on the island and would definitely recommend it! 😊 Nice experience by taking zipwire to Nami Island Is the nice place to visit and it is famous mostly due to the Korean drama - Winter Sonata. We not manage to watch the red maple leaves but it still the nice scene.If you brave enough can take the zipwire to Nami Island (besides ferry). Although is quite expensive (KRW 38,000.00 where it covers the admission fee to Nami Island as well as the ferry ride back) but is a good and memorable experience.You may take photo with the couple snowmen which is shown in the Winter Sonata. You can go via First Kiss Bridge and the “real” one is located by the lake after the First Kiss Bridge) Not a must To get to nami island from Seoul, there are trains to Gapyeong Station. Once there you can choose to take the city tour bus or public bus. The bus stop are just right outside the station exit and there are timetable for the bus and a tourism counter nearby, you can't miss it. The tour bus go to every tourism attractions within Gapyeong area but if you just want to get to nami island, take the public bus as it is much cheaper. At the wharf, you can choose to zipline to the island or take the ferry.This place is for family and couples, the place got the family fun and romantic feel to it. I wasn't a fan of the place though, many places were closed or under construction when I was there on Jan 2018. Still, there wasn't much to see, the tall trees are nice but that's about it, the place doesn't feel natural, it is small and fill with tourists during winter, can't imagine what it is like during warmer times. I can't penalize this place because it is what is meant to be and not a place for solo traveler who like to surround by pure nature."
"Stunning scenery We visited korea last month and Nami Island was one of the attraction the tourist guide was telling us on our first day..Nami Island was famous because of the korean drama Winter Sonata.I did browse the internet and truly it was beautiful.Unfortunately it was winter when we visited the place so i did not expect so much.The river was frozen and there were diggings due to ice.I guess spring would be better.Overall,the place was nice.We stayed there for an hour and took the time to enjoy the coolness and the fresh air Nami could offer."
"A must visit in South Korea Book a day tour to visit Namiseom Island - Gapyeong Railbike Tour - Petite France (all cost around S$200 via Changi Recommends website) as they are worth your visit! It’s around 1.5 hour drive from Seoul so if you take public transport, it will be more troublesome. We visited Nami Island around mid december and we were lucky to see some patches of snow (although not heavy snow). Basically you need to take a chartered ferry to Nami Island (the ferry runs frequently, only around 10min journey time).The whole island can be covered within 3-4 hours by foot. It was cold though. There is one halal restaurant swlling Southeast Asian food (tasted good as well). You may want to rent a bicycle to explore the island (but snowy surface may be slippery so we’d rather walk).You must be patient to take photos at good spots that there are crowds of tour groups around."
"Amazing scenery Totally fall in love with this place, it offers a stunning and magical view. Great place to spend some time with family or group of friends, it's a great place take pictures. It's so beautiful!!!"
"Winter can be Bad We went there with a tour group.  The whole island is small but with several good spots for pictures.  Unfortunately, we came on a snowy wintery day.  There were icy road and cold wind, very difficult to enjoy the scenery.  However, I think we will be back again in warmer time."
"Beautiful scenic place Lovely scenic island... good for couples as many good spots for photographs. Cover the island by walking... there are people cycling round the island, but it’s a small area so perhaps better to cover on foot than by bike. Do try the pan fried “toebokki” (not sure of spelling) ... oily and very yummy. Worth the calories."
Beautiful Place not only because of Winter Sonata has taken shoot here I went to this place on February (Winter Season). It has many beautiful sceneries. They provide the sliding ice (I don't know the exact name) even adult can play. I might wanna come back here to explore more.You have to walk further to get to the statue of Bae Yong-Joon from the port.

"stunning beauty of nature very clean and well maintained island, great for everyone and we really enjoy this trip so i recommended to anyone that will go to south korea to avail this tour via KLOOK. Thanks Relaxing excursion You don't have to be a fan of KOREAN drama ""Winter Sonata"" to find it interesting to visit Nami Island. There are enough attractions like the Pine Tree lane, the Gingko lane to enjoy a leisurely walk with your family and lived ones. The island is small 4km at it's widest and laid back. It's a short boat ride 10mins or if you are a thrill seeker you can opt for a grand entrance cash zip wire 38000 krw.Either way you did it a worthwhile visit to the island."
"One of those touristy things you need to do Nami doesn’t offer that much but it’s still a pretty little island in the middle of a river. I don’t have a thing for Korean drama but walking around on (frozen) ground and amidst (bare) trees was a nice change to the concrete jungle of Seoul. Maybe the experience was a lot better for us because we went on a tour and was there very early before all the other tourists came.Nami felt far colder than Seoul,  when I was asked by a local which places I’d been to and mentioned Nami, he said: “ten times colder than here, yes?” It was. If you’re coming in winter, do prepare for the chill. It was pretty enough in winter but I think it would be stunning in spring or autumn.We opted not to eat lunch at Nami but took it instead at the wharf as we had a schedule to keep. There are a lot of restaurants at the wharf and if you are planning to head out to Petite France, I suggest you do the same.Both places may appear to be nothing more than a setting to popular Korean dramas but they still merit a visit even for those who aren’t into that form of entertainment. Nami has its own story to tell, as soon as you’re done with your selfies :) Picture perfect This was my second trip to Nami Island. The first was during autumn 4 years back. I must say that this place never fails to disappoint.  Photos taken looks like they were from the cover of some Korean drama.  Definitely a must visit for k-drama fans."
"Beautiful scenery We went to Nami island by shuttle bus from Insadong Tapgol west gate , departure 9:30am sharp , bought the ticket on the spot from the bus driver . One way ticket was 7,500 won , return was 15,000 won , ferry ticket to nami island & visa 10,000 per person . We reached Nami island 11am . The bus journey was comfortable, free coffee drinks onboard . Once arrive we go direct to take the ferry over to Nami which was a short journey . It was a beautiful island . Spend around 2 hours here and head next to take the city tour bus to petite France ."
"Beautiful island with a lot photo spot I had been to Nami island in 2011. This is my 2nd time. Past 7 years, the island grows a lot. There are many shops, coffee, and restaurant popped up. The famous photo spot from Winter Sonata is the same. Overall is really good indeed."
"Great Experienced in Nami Island Its really one of the best travel experienced specially in Nami Island,  from climate to beautiful sceneries.  special thanks to Jae  Won who assisted us in our  Tour. A very accomodated person.  He make our tour easy and enjoyable. till next tour  to Seoul S. K Beautiful place Very lucky the night before we went to Nami island it snowed, all trees in nami island were covered in white powered snow. Snows falling from the trees made it looks like it's actually snowing. The snow started to melt at noon time and it gets very watery during that time and water droplets kept falling on the trees.We took Metro to Yongsan Station, and from Yongsan Station we took ITX Express(Approx 1hour) to Gapyeong Station. From Gapyeong Station you can either walk(2km) or hire a taxi(5mins, 3,700won) to arrive nami ferry entrance.We arrived early that day and the city tour bus haven't operate so we took the taxi. If the city bus has operated, it's best you buy the bus ticket(1 day pass) for 6,000won if you're planning to go to the other places like petite france, garden of morning calm etc..."
"First snowman village, Unicef child-friendly park, must visit place."
"We never put Nami Island into our winter trip because we thought it is only famous because of Winter Sonata and it isn't children friendly. But while doing our research, we found out that the assumption is wrong.Nami Island is known because of Winter Sonata movie. But not only that, this place was designated the 14th UNICEF child-friendly park in the world and the first in Korea. And for the first time, it has Snowman Village for this winter. Based on that information, we decided to visit this place.When we were there (it's feel like - 24 celcius), everything was covered with snow. Although it was very cold, the kids really enjoyed. They played snowsled, making snow angel, and all kind activities that could be done in winter time.In the middle of this main path, there was a library and indoor playground. We liked it so much. As for foods, we tried lunch boxes and it were very delicious.We really liked this place. We suggest family with young children to visit this place.The entrance fee (including ferry ride) is 10,000 krw for regular, 8,000 krw for senior and teenagers, and 4,000 krw for kids and night visitor."
"Nami: nothing extraordinary Nothing extra ordinary. There’s alot of tourist perhaps because this is the place which some of the korean novelas were shoot. But aside from that, it’s pretty normal. If you want your trip to be a worthit and life changing experience, visit the DMZ and avail the full day tour."

Worth the Visit - Even During Winter!
"If you love parks, and like walking around, a trip to Nami should be included in your Korea itinerary.My husband and I were there during winter, and despite the -13 deg temp and the blowing winds, we enjoyed our time in Nami, and were able to appreciate its beauty against the snow backdrop. They also had a small sledding hill, where you can try sledding - for free! Another fun thing to do is to try the different food vendors all throughout the park. We found the park food, not only affordable, but delicious as well."
"A must go place; Good place to take pictures We booked a tour package to go to this island (go to the trazy.com website). Our tour guide, Andy, was friendly and informative. This is a great place to take pictures. I recommend you to go to this island during autumn, because during winter, there was no flowers and leaves, but the view was still great. There was a halal restaurant with affordable price for Muslims and also a Musolla for Muslims to pray."
Very nice and romantic place Visited this small island recently and it is a very romantic place for a walk. We took many nice photos and marveled at the nature landscape.there are also a few nice cafes on the island.
Autumn leaves and weather perfect for photography Your Seoul adventure will not be complete without a visit to NAMI ISLAND•15 minutes ferry transfer from ticket booth to island proper•board an electronic shuttle to go around the island top sites•board a train to go around the garden•on your way back please TRY THE CHICKEN BARBECUE!!! Awesome!
"Favorit Place in Korea This is the Best tourist destination i've ever visited in my life. It's very beautiful, you can take a picture on every corner of it or you can just enjoying the place by walk and see the nature. I came here on winter, which is one of the best time to visit nami island because when the snow start to fall from the sky, it will be very awesome... oh i really loved it Wonderful place An absolutely beautiful place must visit if you can spare one day extra except shopping in Seoul.  I join the local tour, leave at 8am from Myeongdong and return around 6pm.  As most of you know , the island is used for shooting the famous Korean drama Winter Sonata."
Perfect winter getaway Nami island is so pretty in winter that every corner is so nice. The vibes given is perfect from a city getaway. We went quite early as there were less crowd. You need to go to Gapyeong station and take a shuttle bus (krw 6.900) or can take a taxi to ferry pier. The shuttle bus is recommended as you can drop by other places as you like.
"Just wow Took a day trip to Nami island and what a visit it was. You can either get to the island via ferry or for the thrill seekers a zipline! Fully recommend hiring a bike and cycling around, can truly say it is one of the most tranquil places i have ever had the chance to visit even considering the amount of people that visit everyday Fun and a romantic place Where winter sonata was filmed...Spend  a day here because 4-5 hours is not enough to enjoy this romantic and fun place.Good for family and couples.There are restaurantsSouvenir shopsActivity shopsCafeHistorical billboardsPlayground for kidsBooks for kidsAvailable at the playgroundKept in a character designed book shelves15 mins ferry rideThey also have hotel’sCabin for rentBike trailsAnd beautiful landscapeGood for photoshootMeditation andAlot more...:) Crowded place."
Tour is average but the drawback are it is extremely full packed and when you are with some rude tourists who doesn't speak english it will be a disaster.
