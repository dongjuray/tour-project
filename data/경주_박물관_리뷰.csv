review
"It’s amazing  how you can preserve nature , seeing crabs and mud skippers priceless ."
A beautiful museum with the most beautiful works of art in Korea. In Geyongju you can easily spend two days to see all the sights at your leisure.
Small but interesting museum of Korean history from ancient times through the Sila dynesty with many interesting archaeological treasures and various treasures from Royal burial tombs excavated nearby. English signage was sufficient and museum is nicely designed. As an added bonus it is free. A 90 minute visit is sufficient to see everything.
"Excellent museum if you are interested in cultural history. Free access and easy access. Really special is how the museum helps you see universal paths in human development. In the tools, but also the social structure, faith, symbols etc.. how things like fertility keep coming back etc.. An extremely friendly volunteer who explains everything in English and who builds a walkable path through the many objects. Recommended"
"There's not much in this museum. The most interesting is the building itself which is a typical architecture of the region. Positive point, the visit is free j! I imagine this place is good in case of strong heat or rain. I did not find it interesting."
"The admission is free, some interesting artifacts located around the main building. The main building takes you through multiple eras in Korea's history. Top notch experience. There is also a 7-eleven and cafe located on th property if you get hungry during your visit."
"The Gyeongju National Museum exhibits treasures from the Silla Dynasty. Admire gems, weapons and ceramics that illustrate the cultural richness of this historic Korean era."
Where to know the history of Sinara Also the racing museum treasure.There are artifacts from the Holy Spirit King's New Race Book. Hear the souvenir shop.
"Big, beautiful and very interesting. Illuminated in the evening, so very nice to see and photograph the sunset there. Very illuminating how and why the burial mounds are located in Gyeongju. Take plenty of time for it."
"The museum covers a large area and exhibits are displayed both outdoors and in buildings. Admission to the permanent exhibition is free of charge. The plant alone is worth seeing. Among the exhibits, jewelry is a highlight, especially since such specialized techniques were used here that are still unparalleled today."
"There is a lot to see here! There are at least four buildings with exhibitions (though one was closed when we were there - no biggie as we ran out of time anyway). It has all sorts of artifacts from Gyeong-Ju and other places in South Korea, especially from Silla-related sites. Mucho f it is in English, too, and it's very informative. It's well worth the price, and it's well-served by public transportation. There's a nice coffee shop on its premises just in case you need a break. The replicas of Bulguksa's Seokgatap and Dabotap also make great photo opportunities. Don't miss the replica of the Emile Bell, either!"
"Truly an excellence! Museum not to be missed. Very large, very interesting with unique finds. Fantastic part dedicated to jewelry."
Gyeongju National Museum provides an immersive experience into the Silla Dynasty with its impressive collection of relics and artifacts. A cultural journey worth taking.
It was a great place to learn about Silla Dynasty. I went at night and it was not crowded at all. The entrance is free and it is walking distance to other historic sites.
"Entrance to the museum is free. There are a few halls that have displays. There is a wide variety of objects from the Silla period, varying from stone relics, to pottery and very beautiful gold artifacts. The display is very nice with English explanations. The museum is very quiet, a real pleasure to walk around and enjoy all there is to see."
"If you want to discover the treasures left behind by the Silla Kingdom, make Gyeongju National Museum your first stop. Artifacts covered in gold and decoration, displayed primarily in Tumuli Park, are displayed alongside more mundane objects intended to illustrate everyday life."
This museum shows wonderful pieces and archeological founds and grants great background info regarding Gyeongju's history.
Free museum. Museum made up of several buildings. Beautiful presentation of the collections. Second largest museum in Korea.
"A fantastic museum, the structure is beautiful and elegant, the finds kept are incredibly important and evocative. It is very modern and set up with wisdom, grace and intelligence. Even a Westerner understands simple videos that are essential and yet important for understanding. It is the largest museum in Korea and is absolutely worth the trip to Italy too. There are several pavilions and all of them are interesting (even the bar one where you can taste very good things at reasonable prices)"
Museum was not too big and will take at most 1 hour. Very educational exhibits which were also in English of the history of the Silla Empire. The most prominent exhibits were the unique style of the crowns worn by the Silla Kings. Well worth a visit and will complement what you see at the Cheonmachong Tomb.
"Completing our walk out from the city centre it was another fifteen mminutes further on from the Woljeong Bridge to our final destination, the Gyeongju National Museum. This is a complex of buildings and grounds to be explored all for free, while we only spent 1.5 hours here, a visit could last a lot longer. We thoroughly enjoyed viewing all the artefacts and objects, the stunning and exquisite golden crown and jewellery discovered in the Geumgwanchong Tomb in 1921 is on display, simply majestic. The musuem is well patronised but not too busy so we were able to spend a few minutes up close to all displays. There was plenty of English descriptions to keep us well informed, this museum is highly recommended when visiting Gyeongju. Loved it. Parking is available on site, as we did not use it I'm not sure if there was a fee attached. In the carpark were a few stalls selling simple food and drink."
Worth visiting for view of the actual relics. Our guide was informative and helpful. It’s part of a number of things to do here
"Very interesting Museum with many artifacts from the Silla Kingdom presented. Special exhibition also showcased artefacts from one of the tombs in central Gyeongju, but permanent galleries were also interesting and insightful to see and read the excavated artefacts from the kingdom. Entrance is free. Recommend to go in the evening so that your next stop can be Donggung Palace and Wolji Pond, as it is better viewed at night."
"This is an excellent and free museum. There is a huge range of artefacts, very well presented. Be aware there are no refreshments inside the halls. Use the cafe in the grounds."
"Gyeongju National Museum isn’t that large but the quality makes up for the lack of quantity. The curators did a fantastic job of setting up the displays that make the Silla-era treasures look exponentially cooler. The organization is also excellent and good explanations are in both English and Korean. The museum grounds also have some displays including replicas of the Bulguksa temple pagodas. This should be the first stop in Gyeongju, especially for those who are not familiar with Silla’s history."
This is one of the best museum I've visited. It has an excellent range of Silla artifacts on display. A definite must visit when in Gyeongju.
"This is large, impressive museum dedicated to the Silla culture. It has several buildings that are very well organized following a chronological order and with dedication to several aspects of the life of the Sillas including domestic and common aspects and royals features. The exhibit on the tomb treasures is impressive! Curation is excellent! Labels are in Korean and English. The Silla's bell is just beautiful. The bell is outside the museum and the exhibit is great, with excellent illumination. At night is really beautiful! We did not have to pay. It was a Korean holiday when we visited and because of this, the museum closed one hour later! We visited the museum in the afternoon. We spent 3 hours at the museum. when we arrived to the museum, it started to rain; rainy days are perfect for museum visits. The rain lasted for two hours; when we went to see the gardens, it was dry and pleasant. Because the museum closed late at 700 pm, we were able to see many sculptures, pagodas, and the bell located in the museum gardens with almost nobody around. The gardens looked beautiful at sunset. Lightning was really good. We learned a lot! The museum deserves at least 3 hours. We visited on September, 2019."
"Spacious. Lots of exhibits to view. From weapons to plates & armors, from ancient coins to pottery & stones, from clothes to shoes and many more. The different Eras & transformations. There are a few halls. Come see the Korean history."
"Viewed the Buddhist bell and the gold jewelry of the ""Flying Horse Tomb"" but had to race through the rest of the museum. Visited many sites in Gyeongji (all quite wonderful) and did get some Silla Kingdom history and Silla Kingdom cuisine along the way. An earlier visit to the museum would have been wise."
"I know I would have enjoyed the National Museum much more without as much rain. But on the day we were there it was coming down in buckets. Anywhere that provided shelter was a good place. I was most fascinated by the National Museum's Divine Bell of King Songdok. Enormous and with a very deep and rich tone. But while your eyes are drawn to its overall size, looking more closely at its details was rewarding. Check out my pix."
"A must-see if you have seen the tombs and want to see the real relics found in them. The displays are esthetic and the glass protection is almost invisible. It’s amazing to see relics from Shilla, so evolved."
"We wandered around the museum after visiting all the attractions en route and it was good to read about the history of everything we’d seen. The exhibits are all presented in English too. A very modern, interactive museum. There is also a children’s museum underground which we didn’t visit but the entrance looked inviting if you had young children in tow!"
"Many of Korea’s national treasures are here, mostly from the Silla kingdom that once dominated the peninsula. Don’t miss the two private collections in the outer buildings."
I spent about an hour and a half walking around this informative museum. It's definitely worth visiting to learn more about the Silla Dynasty. I especially enjoyed seeing the gold crowns that were found in the royal tombs. The only downside was that it was very busy with large groups of loud school children.
"A visit begins at the deep toned and resonant bell in the forecourt. From there you move into the museum proper. It has models of the palace layout and is full of items excavated from the site. The moat has, like most “garbage tips” provided detail of life within and around the palace. Plus there are also valuable palace relics: especially the gold and gold crowns."
This is a well laid out museum complex where you will need to allocate 2 - 3 hours to get the most benefit here. It goes through in some detail about Korean history. It is a must see.
"When visiting renovation work was being carried out so we were unable to access all areas. The musuem covers the history of the Silla period with displays of architecture, pottery, jewellery, tools, pots & day to day articles. English explanations are on all exhibits. The museum also covers the raise of Buddhism in the area"
Extremely interesting and beautifully organised museum. Absolutely worth spending some time there during your visit in Gyeongju.
Beautiful exhibits set up in several nicely designed buildings. The grounds are pleasantly landscaped too! Plenty of parking. A very small gift shop near the entrance
Very comprehensive + beautifully arranged exhibits of the old (one of 3) medieval kingdom before Korea was unified.
"We visited the museum primarily to see the exhibits of gold discovered in ancient royal tombs. The gold, design, and execution of these pieces were dazzling . It was certainly enlightening to learn of these Korean treasures, ones that I had never heard of prior to this visit. Worthy of comparison with ANY other ancient kingdom’s treasures."
I have been to many museums and usually they are quite overstuffed that you found it boring. Somehow it wasn’t here. There are many complexes but I only went to the main complex where the historical artefacts are housed. They are well documented and fun to go through them. From golden collections to stone monuments and porcelain items. It was raining when we came and the museum was quite busy. But we really enjoyed this museum.
"I've been to about 5 museums in Seoul and Andong in the last 1.5 weeks and Gyeongju national museum is by far the most interesting and engaging. You know how there are those museums that loose you after 20 minutes because it's either too much information, too little information or just plain boring? Gyeongju National museum isn't one of those. it's got just enough of information displayed throughout the exhibitions to help you with the history, and with lots of interesting things on display. it's got a little bit of everything for everyone. you've got the shiny gold treasures, the everyday artifact that show you how the lives were or the interesting history that normally would make it very hard to digest. it's just got a little bit of everything for everyone. The museum actually has a number of halls on the ground and it'd be lovely to have a couple of hours here. and if you are here during the lunch time and worry about not having any restaurants around.. fear not, there's a 7-11 convenient right in the museum ground and you can get those really yummy and cheap microwave lunch box or instant noodles there. they even set up tables and chairs inside just like a restaurant does. hight recommend it for sure."
"This museum is not to be missed when visiting Gyeongju. The sheer amount of artifacts displayed from the Silla Kingdom is astonishing. The beauty of the artifacts will surely impress you and so many gold jewelry will make your head spin. The museum is comprised of different buildings that showcase different historical artefacts. The rooms are spacious and some of the artefacts are displayed outside. My absolute favorite: the Divine Bell, which sound you can hear every 15 minutes."
"This is a UNESCO World Heritage Site. It is a very complete collection of artifacts situated on a site of royal tombs. The impressive Divine Bell is rung every 15 minutes. It’s sound is so mellow, be sure to hear it. The large collection of gold and bejeweled crowns is also noteworthy. Allow at least 90 minutes if not more to see everything. Don’t rush."
My family visited the Gyeongju National Museum in June 2019. It is a beautiful museum which is well laid out and wheelchair accessible. It takes about two hours to see it all and is well worth the time if you are in Gyeongju. Most of the exhibits relate to the Silla kingdom. We loved it!
"This was a multi-building museum on a large park like campus setting that was filled with a lot of interesting historical items from the Silla period and the surrounding area. Don't miss visiting here! Outdoors, the musuem displayed a lot of stone carved statues, lanterns, stupas and a the Divine Bell of King Seongdeok. All were nicely arranged, well preserved and explained in multiple languages. There were four main galleries that we wandered through. 2 were dedicated to the Silla dynasty history and art, 1 for Wolji pond and a special exhibition gallery. The amount of history, beauty and details made this one of the best museums we visited on our trip to Korea. At the back of the museum grounds was a relatively new looking bridge that took us to a very large building that was used as a storage vault for all the other historical items that could not be displayed. It was very modern inside and maybe a couple of visitors besides ourselves. They had a very interesting room that had lots of displays about the conservation processes used for historical objects as well as how they are protected in the musuem. The other part of the building was dedicated to the storage vaults some of which were visible through glass windows. Definitely worth the walk to see it. We were also happy to see a 7-11 on site as we were hungry and thirsty after our sightseeing. It had both indoor and outdoor seating to relax and enjoy our snacks."
"The gold crowns, ornaments, and jewelry from the Silla tombs are truly impressive works of art in a beautiful park-like setting, and there is much else to see as well. It deserves several hours to appreciate. Good descriptions in English, too."
This museum was amazing.. really informative about the history of Silla and Gyeongju. Loads to see and free!! Could spend half a day just exploring this museum.
Beautifully set out with some amazing exhibits of ancient and traditional culture and the old Silla dynasty
The entrance was free and museum has interesting exhibits. It has english description on the exhibits and hence an audio guide was not exactly necessary. They do provide free english guided tours but only on Saturdays and Sundays. Can easily spend about 1-2 hours here to soak in the culture and the history of the Shilla Dynasty. The museum is very organised and well kept and not very touristy. Would highly recommend a visit for history buffs
Many valuable historical treasures of the ancient Silka dynasty of Korea. Should visit here before heading to the outdoor sites.
Nice museum to spend some time. You can learn a lot about the history of the country. Well organized. After the visit to the museum you can walk back to the city center through the park with the tombs.
We found this to be an nice museum with a good mix of interesting exhibits and helpful and knowledge staff.
"This National Museum is worth visiting, displaying many local artificial and providing information of history of the country."
"Came down to the museum for a quick 30 minute jaunt and wound up staying over 2 1/2 hours. Angela was an amazing tour guide. She commanded a great knowledge and depth of the Silla and Joseon Kingdoms, much more than the audio tour or the pictorals. She had a lot of great stories and provided great insight into the daily lives of royalty and commoners in the from the Stone age through the end of the Silla dynasty. Highly encourage coming here and getting the tour."
"This museum has a large collection of art works and artefacts from local Korean history, and is said to be the best in the country. It’s free, the staff speak some English (they called a taxi for me as there is no taxi rank) and many of the captions are in English. There is a souvenir shop near the entrance, and a coffee shop. The huge bell in a separate building to the right of the main building is worth a close look, and a recording of its chime. Is played every 20 minutes (it’s worth waiting for)."
Worth visiting. There is quite a bit to see and english information is provided. We learned a lot about the Silla period. The museum grounds are also quite nice.
"For those visitors wanting to know more about the Shilla dynasty and the history of Gyeongju, a few hours spent at the National Museum will provide you those insights and more. There is plenty to see. The area surrounding the museum is well set out and includes a coffee shop and souvenir shop. Be prepared for stairs though...about 25 of them from ground level to the entry for the museum, a few less for the gallery. There are also nice resting points with benches or seats to take in the peaceful environment."
A really cool museum that gives you a great overview of the history of the area. All of the items on display were really well interpreted. I'd recommend coming here as a first stop to give you a background before visiting the historic sites.
I would say this is the #1 attraction in Gyeongju. Everything is very well curated & it’s amazing to see some items only discovered in recent times. Free admission too!
"Once more tumuli(burial mounds, only three of the 1,000 nearby have been opened) are opened they will have to increase the museum capacity many fold. It is well set out, welcoming, good signage and extraordinary artefacts. Love the gold ornaments. Hear the Divine Bell if King Seondeok strike every hour in the garden."
"We spent our first afternoon in Gyeongju at this museum with a free English speaking tour guide. As we walked through the museum, she gave us great insight into the Shilla dynasty as she pointed out the items excavated during continuing archaeological digs. In fact, Gyeongju is effectively one big dig as they are continuing to explore and uncover items from their heritage. The museum itself has been well designed and is a beautiful place to visit."
"The Gyeongju National Museum exceeded all expectations and we easily could have spent more time. Read on for details. The strength of this museum lies on its location in the heart of Korean Silla history and culture. The presence of nearby large burial grounds has been a rich source of incredible artifacts, from pottery fragments to entire pottery collections two weapons cast in the iron to beautiful fabrications with gold. They are all laid out in a manner to display the ascendancy of history and culture in this part of Korea. It was informative and eye-opening. If you have any interest in the cultural history of Korea or this area including the origin and anthropology of the people here the museum is worth your trip."
Magnificent museum! no entrance fee. The different exhibitions are of high quality and perfectly presented. English explanations. Impressive and varied artifacts throughout the ages !
"Large property with multiple buildings. Well laid out exhibits with many English translations. Some very nice and unique pieces from the region. Went on a Tuesday and was joined by dozens of elementary school classes. There is no café for meals, so eat before going there. No restaurants in the immediate area either. Required either taxi or bus from the train station as it was not close."
By visiting this place you will better understand the history of the area. The artifacts are quite stunning although this is a fairly small museum. We read many of the plaques but not all and took us about 2-2 1/2 hours for the main museum and the art museum.
"This is a nice museum with an excellent explanation of Korean history. I learned a lot. The beginning of the museum (very oldest stuff) isn't that much different than you'd see in any civilization's exhibit about early humans and how they developed tools, etc...but if you're into that thing, this is a through exhibit. I really enjoyed the exhibits about the various dynasties and was pleased to learn why everything nice is called ""Shilla"" in Korea. The gift shop is a good place for less tacky souvenirs. The museum would do well to put some benches around. There were about six benches throughout the entirety of a very large museum, and people need to be able to sit down occasionally."
Having visited quite some museum it is always interesting to discover the pieces you won't see elsewhere .. unless borrow for an exhibition
"This is the primary museum in Gyeongju and is really a collection of multiple different buildings/museums on one site. The primary museum, dealing with the history and rise of the Silla Kingdom, was my favorite. The English audio guide (rented for ₩1,000) provided some insight into exhibits and relics that would otherwise have been a mystery. There is a good amount of English text accompanying about 85% of the exhibits. There is also a museum focusing on Silla art, which is largely centered around Buddhist iconography and sculpture. This summer, there is also an exhibit (largely in Korean), on the ongoing exploration of Hwangnyongsa Temple housed in its own building. Finally, there is a building that shows artifacts recovered from Wolji Pond, where the Crown Prince’s palace was formerly situated. The best thing about this museum is that it provides context for many of the sites you can enjoy visiting in the area around Gyeongju. A stop best made early on in any trip to the ancient Silla capital!"
"This is a nice visit in a reasonably preserved site. Although the place is beautiful, it is relatively poor from na archeological point of view."
A well curated museum that you must visit if you want to understand the history of Gyeongju. The place is filled with historical relics with insightful explanation. The complex is also huge so you can spend ample time here. The buildings are also well air-conditioned with sufficient facilities. Enjoyed our time here as it gave us a better understanding of Gyeongju.
"We visited the museum as part of a cruise ship tour. Our guide did a good job ib pointing out the main exhibits or ""highlights"", but unfortunately the time we were allowed was not nearly enough to see and experience very much of the collection. It would be great to return someday and spend time on our own."
"This museum has several buildings with different topics. Even the kida part. It presents well the ancient kingdom Silla, the first entire-korean country."
"July 21st I visited the national museum and I was very impressed. Lots of items to see thus gaining a perspective on the development of civilization at that time. Also I encountered a yellow skinny cat, could someone feed it please? I did not have any food with me, and considered going back the next day, but it was very far away and too hot. Could someone please take care of this poor creature?"
Our tour group stopped here during our trip from Busan to PyeongChang. It’s a very impressive museum. The museum is comprised of several buildings. Displays are related to the Silla Dynasty which are labeled in Korean and English. The rooms are spacious and well-organized. Admission is free. Be sure to pick up the free pamphlet at the entrance with a map of the museum and description of the galleries and highlights. There are also outdoor displays. There were a number of school groups in the museum on the day that I visited.
Great museum. English subtitles let you understand the Silla empire in good detail. Nicely laid out design with ample room to roam. Probably allow at least two hours to see the halls and grounds. Well worth the time.
The Geyongju National Museum is well worth a 2 to 3 hour trip as an introduction to the history of the Silla Dynasty and the many historic sites around Gyeongju.
Free attraction so really why not go. But honestly it is one of the best museums we’ve seen in Korea. There are numerous buildings and a kids museum onsite. There are detailed explanations in English to explain the history and significance of some of the artifacts. Definitely must check it out if you are in Gyeongju.
Really informative exhibits with lots translated into English. Amazing collection from the Silla and great to learn more about the tombs in the town and the ancient history of the region. Really interesting and definitely worth a visit while in Gyeongju
"This period of history was new to me and I found the Korean artifacts in the museum amazing. I particularly loved the gold crowns, the jewellery and the Buddhist relics. Wow...... what wealth they had years ago. One of the buildings was closed, but we enjoyed the gardens and saw and heard the huge Divine Bell of King Songdok."
"This is really one of the best history museums in Korea, though it should be noted that it covers just one period of history. Remember that the complex consists of several buildings, so don't leave after you have finished with the main hall. Free admission, though you still have to get a ticket from the booth. Not sure why that is."
"This is a fabulous museum, filled with artifacts from the area across time. But it does concentrate on the Silla period and there is plenty to display. From stone to bronze to copper to gold; from tools to jewels; from architecture to boating to steles, we found the displays interesting and well organized and described. Many of the items on display come from the tombs excavated in the area. There are several buildings here, one of which houses a donor collector’s collection which complements the main collection, and presents some fine religious stone statues and metal figures. Another highlights art and architecture from Wolji Pond and palace. The sound of the famous bell outside (though played through speakers) is beautifully rich, as is its ornamentation. Do not miss this opportunity to discover the history from the area."
"Quite a rare site with a lot of ancient tombs excavated. You may spend 2 - 3 hours walking in the park, and visit the museum (closed for new displays in April 2018). There is also a palace site nearby with decent walking paths along the nicely landscaped gardens and lakes. There are also a good range of restaurants providing lunch after the visit."
"This is a fabulous museum with hundreds of wonderful artifacts from the Silla period, and if you are doing the whole area over more than a day is a great introduction to the many historical sites that abound in this area. This is a world class hotel. Just sufficient enough english to enable you to understand. And remember, this is all about an era when England was transitioning from Roman occupation through to the dark ages And it's free!"
"I was woefully ignorant about the Silla civilization. No longer, however. This museum should be on everyone's bucket list if one is interested in the ancient world. This ranks with the Parthenon Museum, the British Museum, the Metropolitan Museum of Art, and the Louvre. The antiquities on display are astounding and so unexpected. Really makes one feel so ignorant to have not known about the Silla. The decorative arts were at a very high level compared to the same period in Europe. We spent about 3 hours here. I really want to come back again."
"Grateful that this fabulous museum is free, but it is worth more. We loved the design, the content, the grounds, and all that we learned. Thank you to all who created this gem of a museum! The history on the Silla dynasty really helped us understand the history of Korea and added many insights on all of the archeological digs. Wish we had gotten their sooner and had more time to explore other buildings."
"After seeing the great exhibits of this area in the Korea National Museum, it was fantastic to see so many relics in this museum."
"Visiting all the exhibits will Take about 2 to 3 hours. Parking and entrance is free. On the weekends, the place does get packed due to tourists and bus tours. The exhibits are broken into several buildings. The main building has most of the Silla artifacts. Another building will have artifacts from Wolji pond. Another building has Buddhist artifacts. Highly recommend visiting this museum!"
"This is an excellent museum. Artefacts are presented in chronological order which gives a deep and easy to understand account of Gyeongju and Silva’s history from the Bronze Age until around 950CE. It is a perfect thing to do on a rainy day, and also as a way to orient to Gyeongju on one’s first day visiting."
"For a bit of background into the Silla culture this museum is an excellent starting point. It has an extensive collection of artefacts gathered from the various burial mounds and temples in the region with good explanations in Korean, English, Chinese and I think Japanese. The history gallery is the best, with most variation in artefacts. The other galleries are really more of the same with a lot of pottery and so on, although they are also well-presented. There are audio guides for rent (I didn't).
Entrance is free, although you have to collect a ticket from the ticket booth. There's a 7-Eleven for drinks and snacks and ready noodles. It's maybe an hour's walk from the centre of Gyeongju via the burial mounds, or there seemed to be loads of buses going past."
This is a good museum to see the treasures from the Silla Kingdom and the temples around Gyeongju region. I recommend watching the animated Silla Kingdom video which has English subtitles. The theater where the video is shown is located outside of the museum itself in a separate area that is clearly marked and the video viewing is free to the public.
"Seeing all those historical artifacts that I saw from my textbook was sooooooo satisfying for some reason. So so so coooool. It was like watching walking dead, but instead of the dead, it was history. It was walking history."
"All artefacts are nicely presented. You can find gold crowns,, weapons, bronze artefacts etc. Do not forget the huge bell outside the building and do not miss the the building with all the findings from Anapji Pond. You should clean up your pond occasionally, too, look in the museum what you possibly can find.."
"It was super nice for me, if you want to learn Korean history and also ancient societies items you can choose National Museum. You can find everything over there."
"Top quality, interesting museum. Well worth the visit to see the crowns and the bell if nothing else."
"If interested in Korean history or culture, or the Silla Kingdom, this is a fabulous museum. It is a small gem but it has a lot to offer. Not to be missed."
"If you want to know more about the Korean history since waaaay back time, come here! Gives you a nice perspective on how the society were back then, also about the integration of Buddhism into the society. Take your time, don't rush, absorb all the history."
"If you intend to visit one museum in Korea this one seems to be the best, and that is in line with my experience. Great exhibit of thousands of ancient artifacts, with informative explaining texts. It taught me a lot about Koreas history and that of the Sila empire in particular. Don't miss it. Oh, and did I say it was free of charge? Really, don't miss this!"
The best way to enjoy Gyeongju in my opinion is to gain some knowledge of its rich history before you start hitting the sites. The museum is a great way to do this - free entry and free tour available. I took the tour in Korean but enquire to check if available in English. I recommend going early to stay ahead of the rush of groups -this place is very popular for families with children and students.
"Gyeongju National Museum is far from awesome! I have never visited a museum that was so intensely curated with the amazing artifacts that are the building blocks of Korean history. It's not just crowns and jewelry from ancient royal emperors; but this place is filled to the brim of archaeological artifacts excavated from exactly where they are in their own city. I saw handmade pottery, rickshaws, and even ancient hieroglyphics. How amazing is that? And that's because I never heard of any Asian hieroglyphics before. So seeing an entire wall of a slab chalk-full of them just blew my mind. There is so much history waiting to be found just beneath our feet. So if you're interested in ancient Korean history seen like none other before, this museum is definitely a pit stop for you. NOTE: I visited this museum with my teenage sister and her friends and they all seemed to really enjoy themselves. So this museum is definitely family-friendly for all ages, for both the young and old. Enjoy!"
"We loved the museum. Especially the combination of the museum and a visit of the 2 parks of Gyeongju is ideal. The entrance of the museum is for free (you must get a ticket though, but the ticket is for free). The museum consists of several buildings with permanent or temporary expositions. I recommend to visit at least the main building. They explain over there how the green grass hills with graves are constructed (watch the short video in the museum). That is really interesting, because you look different at the green hills afterwards. You learn a lot about the history of the region during several periods. It's really worth while!"
"In a normal museum, like in this one, quiet is requested from the visitors... If you go one level below in the other building, you reach the kids museum and there... How the hell, be prepared to see many interesting things that your kids will love but also a continuous noise 😂 we loved it and so did our kids..."
"Definitively a must! We were told this was one of the best museums in Korea and we agree. Gyeongju is the home of so much amazing history and it's hard to appreciate just how far back everything goes until you see it here. The HUGE model of what the capital would have looked like is truly impressive. All of the great finds from the tomb are also on view here. The museum is also actually more like three museums in one, with a great Buddhist art gallery and a second history museum. Love it and could have spent hours there."
"Highly recommend the Gyeongju National Museum for those interested in history. It is valuable for understanding the various sites in and around Gyeongju and the Shilla Dynasty which ruled the area for 1000 years. Placards are in Korean and English. Suggest visiting the museum and then going to Daereungwan Tomb Park and the Cheanmachong Tomb. Items are well displayed,"
"Nice regional museum showcasing local historic finds, mostly from royal tom mounds. I particularly liked the golden crowns; I recall seeing two of them; I'm fairly sure the guide said there were six so they may have been in other parts of the museum that I did not see. I liked the Shilla Art section the best with beautiful guilt statues of Buddha as well as the statues surrounding the grounds. Well worth seeing."
"We were visiting a friend in Korea and we sort of gave him free reign to show us around. This museum was one of the first places he brought us in Gyeongju and it was pretty interesting. I felt like I learned a little more having someone from Korea show us around, because a lot of the displays/info boards that had English on them had way more info in Korean than English, so he was able to give us a little more info. There's lots of info here about the history of the area if that interests you."
"Entrance is free, still need to collect ticket from ticket booth in front first. Only need to pay for special exhibitions held in separate hall. Headsets are available from office on right after entry gate. Access to the main hall is up steps, but there is a lift on the left side for elderly and disabled people. The walk through the museum is in chronological order, so you can see how the country developed. Loads of artifacts, including gold crowns, many with explanations in several languages. The Silla art museum hall displays mostly statues of Buddhas. The Wolji museum hall displays artifacts found in the nearby Anapji pond museum area. The Divine Bell of King Seongdeok is outside and the sound it makes is a recording on a 20 minute loop. Didn't travel with children so can't comment on the children's museum found under the special exhibitions hall. There is also a 7-11 store with small cafe area in the grounds. Well worth a visit. Allow yourself at least an hour."
"Due to a leg injury, I couldn't climb the stairs to this Museum but I was more than happy to stroll around the gardens and enjoy the view. Really enjoyed this place and all of its wonderful statues and big bells"
Well worth a look around and free to get in lots of artifacts are local finds and are well displayed.
This complex consists of three halls where all are more or less interesting. Also you can see outside bell!
Museum is situated to more houses. Presentation of objects is very good. Of course clean toilets. Being tired you can sit on the benches outside in the shadow.
Great museum. Lots of information on Korea's history. Personally I think it's even better than Seoul's. Take your time to fully enjoy it.
The museum focuses on the ancient Korean Silla kingdom. It's well laid out and it doesn't take too long to see everything. The signs are all in English and Korean (and most in Chinese too). The grounds are also quite beautiful.
The complex has both outdoor and indoor exhibits. Plan on spending at least two hours. You can walk there from the main town. The exhibit re the Anapji Pond items was very good as were the rooms in the main museum dedicated to the Silla dynasty.
"Divided into three main halls, the artifacts range from prehistoric times to the Three Kingdom Period, as well as items buried with the Royalties in the Tombs of Cheongmacheon area."
"Lots of interesting photo ops and culture .. the bell and story, royalty burial artifacts, outdoor statues and cherry blossom and spring flower blooms. Bathroom and souvenir stalls on the left of entry."
"This is a beautiful museum with interesting grounds to walk around and see statues, pagodas and large bells. The museum itself is well laid out and exhibits have descriptions in English. Unfortunately I only had 30 minutes to see the museum but that was sufficient to get a sense of the area's history and some familiarity with the Silla dynasty that united Korea. An hour to 1 1/2 hours would have been perfect for a more indepth visit."
"Incredible place, with massive artifacts! You can easily spend half day here. It's a great place to learn about the history of Gyeongju."
"Museum with many artifacts. You get a better picture if Koreas history.
Some artifacts (like the krown) are very beautiful. The entrance was free (Don't know if it's like that allways.. We visited the museum in a Saturday). Worth a visit, free entrance or not."
"We went to this museum as part of a shore excursion from Busan. Because the tour left Busan more than an hour late we only had about an hour at the museum which is not enough. This museum is a world class museum. We went to the museum after we went to the Heavenly Horse Tomb. The museum holds a lots of relics of the Silla Kingdom of which Gyeongju was the capital, so it was nice to see the replicas before getting to see the actual items. The museum has several buildings beside the main building which hold the Silla relics. There is a building containing everyday items that were found in a nearby pond as well as a building containing a collection of Buddhas. The museum buildings are in a lovely park setting that we didn't get to enjoy due the time constraint. I would recommend spending 2 to 3 hours for this museum. The museum also has a nice gift/book shop and lots of Western toilets. "
A modern museum with a great wealth of artifacts from the Silla Kingdom. It would be great if they provided an 'historical orientation' with a timeline and maps which one can use to understand the context of the exhibits.
"Wow what a superb and varied collection of artefacts ,well displayed, good English descriptions , the detail on the jewellery was incredible"
visited on our last day in Gyeongju. Their exhibit on the burial mounds was interesting. The crowns were excellent.
"A nice half hour walk south from Gyeongju's urban area finds this medium-sized museum amid rolling grounds. At first, I was disappointed that the buildings were all new. But the exhibits inside were most certainly not!

There are several buildings and if you're a meticulous viewer, you'll need half a day. It is well curated and the exhibits tell the story of the rise and fall of the Silla kingdom which lasted nearly 1,000 years through the first millennium. Gyeongju was its capital.

And surprise! In a separate building there was a smallish exhibition of art (mostly hellenistic) excavated from Afghanistan. It's a temporary exhibition, so by the time you get there, another kind of surprise probably awaits you."
"Perhaps it is because we reached late at around 4.30pm, the man told us entrance is free so we went in and came out with an education of the Shilla period. Really likes how they have English description to most of the items and they took care to give a linear progression of how the society grew from the stone ages to an agrarian one. The burial rites were very interesting because of how different (but at the same time similar to other civilizations) they approach burying their dead. Wouldn't give this a miss as it gives you a fuller understanding of a place. The museum is very near Anapji Pond/Wolji Pond - so would be great to take a leisurely walk there after the museum visit."
You can have an overview of the history of ancient empire of Gyeongju. The exhibits are well presented.
"The museum is one of the most important museum in South Korea. It housed various important artefacts and have a great collections !!! If you ever want to know more about the early kingdoms of Silla especially, then you cannot miss this museum !!! The most important artefacts here are the huge bronze bell of King Seondok on the museum compound and the Silla Golden Crown which was excavated from the Cheonmachong Tomb. Artefacts found from Anapji Pond were also on display here !!! When we came, there was also a special exhibition displaying important relics from Afghanistan !!! I have visited numerous museums in East Asia and I think this is one of the more exciting museum (though it was not as big compared to the others) but the treasures it housed were extraordinary !!!"
"This has been a very interesting visit to this museum about the history of the Silla empire. It took us one and half hour to see this museum and the annex that had a special exhibition of treasures from Afghanistan. The museum shows artifacts, weapons, pottery and many beautiful jewels of the Silla empire that lasted almost a thousand years. It is highly recommended to rent an audio guide at the souvenirs shop, just after the entrance, to help you orient and received additional information about most of the panels that are in Korean only. Some of the audio tracks will start automatically as you walk by the glass displays, but you can start them all manually by selecting the number you see in the caption. We also saw the exposition of jewels and artifacts from Afghanistan that have been save before the war ravaged the country which was very beautiful and interesting too."
"Well worth the visit if you're into art and history.Was intrigued by the history,artefacts of Korea etc.Was pleasantly surprised to know they had a special screening of Afghanistan's culture and artifacts etc.Brilliant."
"This is an exceptional Museum with a number of different buildings displaying varied exhibitions. Unfortunately we did not have enough time to do it justice, which was a great pity."
"This easy to reach museum is full of interesting, well presented artifacts, with good explanations in English. You will learn a lot from wandering around the place."
"Title says it all folks. Easy to get to, walkable from what you will be seeing anyhow, it was free when we went ( not sure if this is always the case or not ) and you can go thru it all in less than 2 hours."
"A nicely laid out and interesting museum.
Close to the entrance is a massive bell said to be the biggest of its kind.
Inside the exhibits refer mostly to the Silla Period. The artefacts are fascinating even if you are not into Korean history.
On the day we went, as an added bonus, there was an exhibition of artefacts from Afghanistan.
Well worth a visit."
"Went in knowing little of the Shilla Kingdom and culture and came out with a much better understanding of the history of the area. That is a successful museum to me.

Signs throughout Gyeongju proclaim that ""Gyeongju is Korea"". I know understand what they mean after visiting this museum.

Loved the bell and the bonus exhibition on Afghanistan.

From here we walked over to Anapji Pond. Lovely day."
"We walked from the Gyeongju bus terminal to the museum and saw major attractions along the way (in total it was perhaps a 3,5h slow walk with a coffee break in between). The museum can also be reached via public transportation as there is a bus station close by.
The entry to the museum which consists of multiple buildings is free. Unfortunately we did not have time to visit all of them (as the museum closes at 6pm) but we visited the main one which shows the rise and fall of Silla kingdom. The exhibition is really very nicely done with text and artifacts walking you through the 1000 years history. Not too much and not to little - just perfect, Also the surround of the museum buildings is beautiful - I wished I was able to see more (1h is not enough).

The museum is also like 10min walk to Anapji pond (part of the Silla palace complex) which is also worth visiting especially in the evening."
"Loved hearing the recording of the large bell ringing (every 20 minutes - outside). Amazing instrument!
Information inside comprehensive - gave a clear picture about the history and artefacts on display. Couldn't get over how 2000 year old buckles look just the same as those we use today.
Worth a look."
"This is worth a visit with a good coverage of the Gyeongju history and many important relics from the past (models of the township, Wolji pond, Happiness bell or the Divine bell of King Seongdeok, Dabo tap & Seokga tap pagodas).

There was also a special exhibit for Treasures from Afghanistan."
"The museum is not different from many museums around the word. The exhibitions were well displayed, we found that explanations could have been brought in a more exiting or interactive way.
That being said, the main reason to visit is the impressive collection or artifacts they found in the Cheonmachong Tomb and at the Anapji pond.
A pity that movies were only in Korean."
"As a foreign visitor, I knew next to nothing about Gyeongju before I arrived. On my third day there, the skies opened and released so much rain that walking outside in anything but a swimsuit seemed pointless, so into the museum I went. If you're interested in history and have the time, there is so much to discover there. If you've only an hour then still go - there's plenty of English information displayed on most exhibits. The tombs and temples made much more sense to me after spending an afternoon in the museum."
"Such a great museum, showcasing mostly archaeological finds from the Shilla dynasty. Creative and professional displays, especially those exhibiting the archaeological process. The English labels were good quality too. And we each got a free book about different parts of Korean history, published by the museum! Win win!"
One of the buildings contains unique exhibits found in Anapji Pond which give a unique perspective to the Shila period. This is an excellent museum and well worth visiting for anyone with an interest in the Three Kingdoms period of Korean history.
Really good presentation of the rich number of artefacts found during the excavations of the tombs. Completes the visit to the site itself.
"The museum is worth an hour of anyone's time.
It's free, access is by bus or car.
The museum explains the history of Silla, the mounds and does so very clearly.
Lots of English and Chinese texts in addition to the Korean."
"If you want to learn and understand the history of old Gyeongju especially the age of Shilla(and Goryeo), Gyeongju National Museum is the right place to visit. If you have a kid, you should go visit Kid's museum as well. They will enjoy playing and learning with all kinds of historical puzzles(2D, 3D), stamp, coloring, etc..."
"Good historical museum, with precious statues and artifacts from the nearby tombs and elsewhere. Pretty good English explanation on many items. Certainly worth a visit."
"The museum is composed of four buildings. It's not far from Anapji and stone ice cave so you can arrange these places together. Furthermore, it's educational and free."
there is a joining english tour on saturdays that will fully explain gyengju-si and the Silla dynasty
"Unlike the National Palace Museum in Seoul, this one actually had some nice artifacts mostly swords, armory, jewelry, clay pots etc. what this museum does well is to give one an overview of Shilla history until it was vanquished by Goryu. The artifacts themselves, even the gold crowns and jewelry, are sort of basic in craftsmanship. A highlight of the museum is a big bell crafted in the reign of Queen Seondok. Meh. My understanding is Korea was devastated by so many wars, most historical material were destroyed. So on the one floor of this museum, walkable in an hour or two, the thousand year long Shilla dynasty and prehistory of the region were nicely organized and presented with English subtitles."
"I'm not a fan of history museums but this one stands out as a great place to know about the history of Gyeongju and the Silla Kingdom. Lots of information in English.
And it is free"
This is a very impressive museum. There are 3 three separate buildings and a beautiful garden to walk in. There is a lift to all floors for those with mobility problems. This attraction is a must for history lovers. It offers a complete explanation regarding the Silla dynasty (57 BC – 935 AD). The exhibitions (including good AV and interactive) are well laid out and provide adequate English explanations. There are a lot of artifacts from the Silla time. Staff are extremely helpful. Really recommended!
Extensive modern museum with expertly prepared exhibits and fabulous artifacts of the elegant Silla kingdom.
This museum had a great layout and over several buildings. We learned about the history of the Silla empire and the buildings of the area. It had great examples of Celadon and Jewelry. Its prize possession is the Divine Bell and one of the 7 Gold Crowns discovered here in Gyeongju. We had free entrance on the Sunday we visited which is a plus. We were able to walk here from our hotel downtown which took about 30-40 minutes.
"It was really worth the time - you will get to understand the history of korea a little better especially of the silla period. As of all attractions however, the place was very crowded, with Ppl taking pictures as such. The museum was free of charge and we had the privilege of visiting a temporary exhibit of Korean antique and artefacts seized ans later returned by the Japanese."
"This is one of Korea's largest and most prestigious museums. It is situated in a UNESCO World Heritage Site, and has three permanent exhibition galleries, including the Silla History Gallery, Silla Art Gallery and Woiji Gallery. There is also a Special Exhibition Gallery. The artefacts displayed are amazing and the range of displays is quite spectacular. Definitely a must see if you like rediscovering history. The Divine Bell of King Seongdeok is in the grounds. There are English descriptions at all displays. On Saturdays there is a guided tour in English for foreign visitors which is free. A great place to visit."
"The museum is housed in a modern building. The building was architecturally designed for the museum and shows the exhibits to good effect. Particularly of interest was the tracing of the Silla Kingdom/Dynasty that ruled Korea for over 1000 years from 57BC. The displays were prepared chronologically and included the original gold crowns, necklaces, etc found when some of the tombs were excavated.

The museum also included some finds that have been dated back to the stone age.

One needs a half day to appreciate the artefacts displayed. Most items have English translations on the cards."
"This museum does a great job of laying out (in logical sequence) the history of the Silla Kingdom. Being a non-Korean speaker/reader, I was concerned that I would be left to my own devices, but, this museum has English descriptions on most displays. The flow of the exhibits was good, and I left knowing exponentially more about this fascinating period of Korean history. This is a definite must for any visitors to the area."
"Whilst at the Museum there were 4 main aspects to see; Divine Bell of King Seongdeok; Silla History Gallery; Silla Art Gallery and Wolji Gallery; (the Special Gallery was closed). There was also quite a lot to see in the outdoor exhibition.

Inside the History Gallery there are excellent displays of the artefacts from the Silla Period. The Main feature of the Wolji Gallery was a wooden boat and the many items found in the surrounding area"
This is a great place to learn the history of Korea. There were artifacts all the way back to the stone age. There are English descriptions on many of the signs explaining the various displays.
"We truely loved the gold section. Also great are excarvation explained from Wolji Pond, with a few thousand artefacts on display."
"Literally ran into the museum indoor exhibitions. Some of the items displays are very interesting, for example the drinking game dice. Interestingly however it is also shown at the anapji pond!"
"Ample parking space and free entrance (you do have to collect your free ticket at the ticket booth first). I you want to see everything and like to really read the signs (although not everything has was also in English), you could easily spend more than two hours at this place. Recommend visiting when not raining, because there's also a lot to see outside on the premise."
"I found this museum a good choice after viewing the tombs in order to have further knowledge. However there were five groups of school children there even though it was Saturday. They were not polite, running, etc. They have free English language tours daily at l0am and 3pm. The entrance is free. The grounds have no restaurant but there is a 7 ll for snacks."
"Huge collection, and very well presented except of a lack of English information panels. I wrote to the curator, but never got a response. A must see to understand the Silla history of the area."
This museum is where we started our trip in Gyeongju so we would understand the sites better. It is very well done with the history of the Silla Empire. There is a second building with information on Buddhist sites. The information is both in Korean and English. If you have not been to the Korean National Museum before going to Gyeongju this is a must stop. There is a film about the Buddha Grotto and how it was built.
Very impressive history museum. They have three separate buildings and a beautiful garden to walk through. Each building disolsus Gyeongju history dating back to Shilla Dynasty and their way of life. They have gold crowns on display.
History lovers must come to visit this place. A complete explanation regarding the shila dynasty is presented here from pre historic time.
"Rich in context of Silla dynasty relics.Beautifully built but small. Also the restrooms are spread out quite poorly and this officially has no cafe. 90 % of the signage in the museum is in English.The museum's location is a great walkaround all the way to the old observatory, with a selfie rush in the middle with mustard fields.
But not sure why the Lonely Planet guidebòok called it the best museum in Korea.It isn't but Gyeongju the city itself is. A charming one at that."
"As usual, muséums in Korea are so well settled and organised. I'm impressed and for this one I will return several times."
We enjoyed the grounds and the exhibits. All very interesting especially relating to a chronological order of history of the area.
"The National Museum is a wonderful way to learn about the Shilla dynasty. The exhibits are well done and have excellent English descriptions. The main gallery has so many amazing artifacts. Lastly, the grounds are very peaceful...just a great way to spend a few hours."
"A diverting museum that takes you through the history of the Silla Kingdom. There is a building that takes you chronologically through the pre-history of the area and then the rise and fall of the Silla Kingdom. The majority of sections and artefacts include English language descriptions. There is also a hall focused on the art of the Kingdom and another focused on the architecture.

It is free, has nice grounds and occasionally has special exhibitions (that may be charged for). It is largely straightforward exhibits (artefacts on display in glass cabinets) with the occasional interactive computer screen and some impressive models of how the city used to look.

I'd recommend heading here first if you are pretty ignorant of the history of the place, as it covers the significance of the city and puts all the other historical sites into context."
"Entry to this museum free of charge and we'll worth a visit. They have some fantastic exhibits of the Silla kingdom, of which Gyeongju was the capital about BC57~AD935. Everything is very well laid out and information is presented in English as well as Korean. Allow a couple of hours here."
"This is my second visit to the museum on two different occasion and I am still loving the place and history. First time, I went there by bicycle from express bus terminal, not going to be near but very comfortable ride. You get to pass by all the big tombs and anapji pond on the way over, and get to see the school on the way back. Second time, I went there by bus 10/11. These two buses are the coolest as both set off from bus terminal but one goes right and the other goes left along the circular route. So basically you wait for 10 on one side, and 11 on the opposite side. So to sum up the cool stuff for the museum: (1) Free admission. (2) Lots of artifacts and explanations on the history of Silla. (3) Spacious and condusive for you to immerse in all the history."
"With a focus on Korean pre-history to when Gyeongju was a capital city, easily spend a few hours here discovering more about Korea's past."
We first visited on the day it was closed but were able to tour the gardens. We returned the next day and found the museum interesting and informative. There are lockers for you to store your luggage which was great as we had checked out of our accommodation and were spending time before our train left.
"I would recommend before doing anything else in Gyeongju, go to this museum. Many of the things you will see in this city will just seem normal or not that special, but the museum explains to you what you are seeing so you can better appreciate what you are looking at. Definitely a must do in Gyeongju."
Lots of the history of the origins of S. Korea to be found in this Museum. Worth a few hours visit. Nice grounds too.
"This museum worth it ! It has a free entrance and explains everything about the Silla dynasty
There is also a lot of informations in English
Don t miss the gold crown in the history gallery and the big belt outside !!"
"Take bus 10 or 11 to the museum from the town Centre. It stops almost in front of the museum. Announcements in English for each tourist spot so you won't miss it. There's lockers for the storage of your luggage.
Found the museum very informative. Detailed chronology of the Shilla dynasty. However, there were many replicas. It's good as it gives you a better idea of the items.
The grounds are beautiful and peaceful. As it was December, it was quiet and tranquil. We sat and admire the mountains from the garden.
Recommended to visit."
The museum concentrated on the Shilla kingdom and gave a deeper understanding of the ancient history that shaped and influenced this country.
This museum focuses mainly on the Shilla area with artifacts from the area tombs. There are many vessels and ornaments that are in found condition and others that are artful reproductions. My group was most interested in the awkward and very heavy horse and human iron armor. There are many interesting gold crowns and earrings also on display as well as temple tiles and carvings.
"A free muesum that offers an insight into history of civilization in and around Gyeongju. There are 4 separate buildings: the central building houses the main collection of Silla artifacts, the second houses larger Buddhist artifacts and third building focuses on the adjacent Anapji Pond site. The fourth building is reserved for special exhibitions and is the only building you have to pay to enter.

I would recommend visiting the temple before exploring the sites in Gyeongju as it will give you a better appreciation as to what all the fuss is about."
"Comparing the museum to the National Museum of Korea in Seoul I was not impressed with this museum. Not as much to see, however, a good chronological order leading up to the Silla dynasty and its fall. If you visit during a rainy day, think ahead, because so does everyone else and it will be impossible to see anything. Perhaps a nicer visit would be during a really good sunny day."
"Gyeongju was the long-ago capitol of Korea. Tho many of its treasures have been moved to Seoul, there are lots of important artifacts here. And we were lucky to have an English-speaking docent tour offered when we were there."
This museum is such a good place to explore about the ancient history of Korean in the Gyeongbok province. There are full of many treasures showing there and quite a lot of them are national treasure which have their own stories to tell.
"A wonderful museum, well-organized and displayed with translations in English of the main texts. The objects found in Silla dynasty tumuli tombs have been selected to be representative of the culture. Well curated exhibitions of beautiful objects, many of them National Treasures. And a high-quality museum shop at reasonable prices!"
"This museum is dedicated to the preservation of historical artifacts of Silla. Is is one of Korea's most prestigious museums. Situated within the historic part of Gyeongju, it is listed as a World Heritage sit by UNESCO. The museum has 3 permanent collections: Silla History Gallery, Silla Art Gallery, Woiji Gallery, and one special exhibition gallery."
"The Gyeongju National Museum offers history, culture, religion, and special exhibits of varying types. The four buildings are all spacious, modern, and fully accessible. There are many fine photo opportunities and ample souvenirs are available."
"If your in Gyeongju, this is a must see place. Many artefacts from the burial mounds are on display and it gives a good insight into Korean history of the area."
We only had about an hour here and we were a bit rushed but a person could spend a few hours here. My friend is not a big museum person and even she enjoyed it. There is not lengthy write ups in English about every display but each display is labeled. The main works of art do all have some English write ups. The museum gives a very good overview of the Silla Dynasty and is worth a visit.
"This is a beautiful museum with very interesting exhibitions. If you are interested in the history of the Silla Dynasties, you should definitely visit.

There is no admission fee and the place is well done, with fairly good information in englisch. The only thing I didnt like (but thats not the museums fault of course): when I visited there were several big school classes visiting, so it was very noisy. Also, some of the exhibits are not protected by glass, and many kids touched them."
"i thoroughly enjoyed my visit to this well kept, informative and interesting musuem.
I knew very little about the south korean history and it puts things into perspective with time lines, dynasty's, burial finds,weapons of war and ceremonys. We were aldo approached by a roaming translator in case we had any questions. Most of the displays had were translated into English. we only had time for the history building but there were a few more which we did not have time for.
There is a lift to all floors for thise with mobility problems. The one into the history museum on the ground floor is hidden under the outdoor main staircase and i didnt see it becauae the doors were closed. If you do need the lift i suggest mention this at the ticket office. I didnt see free wheelchairs for public use but i have found that most of the major temples and museums etc provide them by simply handing over some form of low grade identity...
Very clean buildings and grounds"
For those who are history buffs it's a great place to spend a day to understand the history and see how they lived during the Shilla dynasty.
The museum had some history of the Shilla Dynasty. Overall it is small so don't come to the area just for this. It does do a good job of explaining the rise and fall of Shilla but that is it. So if you are looking for a more impressive museum with a ton of things to see then its somewhat of a waste of time given what the museum is focused on one single subject.
"A treasure trove of artifacts from Old Korea including gold crowns, jewels and other items from burial mounds and other tombs in the area. You can see the painstaking care that has been taken to preserve these items as they were found. A video of the grand opening in 1975 was in black and white, which made me feel old. Overall, a great place for students and people who appreciate history."
"Gyeongju National Museum has many objets d'art and artifacts from across the millenia, but it is particularly rich in those from the period when Gyeongju was the capital of the Silla kingdom that eventually unified the Korean peninsula. If you go to Gyeongju, make sure to see the tombs of the Silla kings and queens and especially Donggung palace and Anapji Pond at night when they're illuminated."
This is the place to know more about Korea's history! It's free admission and you will learn & discover the history of Korea through the exhibitions. Great place to be if you're a historic enthusiast.
The museum is worth a visit. Out gives you a nice insight into the history of the area using lots of artefacts. I visited on a Sunday which wasn't the best of all ideas. It is closed on Mondays BTW.
Great museum with rich history and plenty of artifacts. It was really good as museums with lots of words only will tend to bore me out and its the artifacts on display that will keep me interested. There were audio guides for rent and english is available. Recommended to drop by for a visit. We rented bikes to cycle around gyeongju and there were bike parking facilities available too.
I enjoyed visiting this museum and the surrounding grounds. I recommend the use of the audio guides as they provide a nice narrative to the pieces that you are viewing. The arts museum is also a treat to visit.
I liked the full collection & the free gift we got once we entered the museum. Nice statues. You must take to time to read the text next to the art as it explains lots of history of Korea.
"The Shilla History Gallery shows prehistoric to mid-century items. Shilla merged with Tang in 503. There are displays of jewelry, weaponry, and ceremonial items from the Shilla Dynasty, including a 5th century gold crown. Outside the main hall is the Emille Bell (King Seongdeok's Bell). Made of stone it's one of the most beautifully resonant bells ever made in Asia."
"On a positive note it is free. However, while the displays may be of some historical importance many of them look like what they are - fragments that have been dug out of the earth. Few of the pieces are particularly beautiful and there seems to be an infinite amount of roof tiles on display. Not a lot of reconstruction or interaction."
"After visiting the mounds and sites around the city, you should pop in here for an hour. The museum is tastefully set up and all displays have an English explanation. And they have all of the real objects taken from the tombs. The gold crowns are exquisite. There are also full explanations of the whole Shilla history. It's an easy and educational hour to cap off your tour to this area."
"Got to know the history of the Shilla dynasty, which lasted a thousand years, started from the 4th century. It is also the kingdom of gold as archaeologists have found various gold, silver and gilt bronzed workmanship as ornaments, bowls, belts, armours and crowns. The Shilla kings were also Buddhists and there is a hall focussing on Buddhist works. Donggung Palace was burned in 935 and many relics ended up in the garden pond, Woji. Hence there is a hall with the rediscovered relics from the pond. Do mot forget to view the Divine Bell of King Seongdeok. The bell has a beautiful silhouette and elegant decorations including apsaras and lotus blossoms. The sound of the bell enlightens the beings."
"We stopped by here as a part of the Gyeongju City Tour - Silla Dynasty sites. The museum has english translations so you can read along. I found it interesting to follow the Korean people through the Silla Dynasty, bronze age and steel age. Seeing another culture's transition through these periods was intersting."
"I'm a bit dissapointed since I expected more with the previous reviews about this museum.The museum has smaller collections than I thought. However, if you have time and interesting in Korean history, you should visit there."
The site is very splendid and we visited 3 buildings of this museum. It was very interesting to learn about Korean history.
"It worth visit this museum to see and understand history of Silla kingdom ,there are a lot of items of Korean cultural heritage,that were found by archaeological excavation, it included jewelry,sculptures of Buddha and zodiacal figures,pagoda and Bell of kingdom."
Some impressive gold jewellery and the exhibits are very well displayed. Entry to the museum is free and for only 2000 won you can get an audio guide. The are some lovely souvenirs in the two shops on the site.
So much Korean culture was destroyed by wars you should take advantage of these museums if in the area. 2 hours should be enough time for most people.
"Informative and interesting. Great for a quick historical background of Korea. Lots of artefacts excavated from the burial tombs about a mile away. Pottery, jewellery, weapons and some architectural pieces (tiles, finials, etc). There were quite a few people there and a lot of them were young students. Its a bit distracting if you enter with them as a lot of them are noisy and push you around so its best to just let them go ahead!"
"This place was good to visit once. The items were great to look at and were displayed nicely. This place was good to visit once. The items were great to look at and were displayed nicely.
Lots of school trips there while we were there. Something to see once, but I wouldn't go back again."
"Nice place to visit with some remarkable works of art. Still unfortunately I believe that a little bit too breezy, not to many things to see. Also a good thing was that we could enter for free"
"We came here as part of the Gyeongju City Tour, and there were many artifacts displayed, inside as well as outside the museum. The displays were well organised and curated, and I believe translation guides are also available for tourists who aren't able to read the displays in Korean. Also on display outside the main museum building is the Emilie Bell, which is a masterpiece in itself. Large number of artifacts on display, considering Gyeongju's long history of Silla and the pivotal part it played in Korea's history. Highly recommend!"
the museum has a great exhibit of most artifacts found in the area and there are many interactive tables. Also a great model of the Silla capital around 900AD is present in the museum.
"It's so rare to see such an amazing curated museum, Gyeongju is a fantastic example of how to do this. They have an amazing collection of artifacts displayed very well. The restoration is superb and it tells a fantastic story of the history of Korea over thousands of years. So many of the artifacts are in pristine condition. There are English translations on most items. This museum is a credit to the country. Highly worthwhile allow about 1.5hrs or longer. "
"This museum is certainly something not to be missed. It has a huge collection of Silla Kingdom pieces. The museum is free, although you still do need to get a ticket before you enter (free souvenir!) They have a few national treasures in this museum, some of the 6 golden crowns that were found are here and they are truly magnificent to see, as some of them are gigantic!. It is bilingual for the most part with 90% of the museum giving the facts and information in english. Very well laid out, very clean and modern."
"The Gyeongju National Museum was very well presented. The amount of artifacts in the museum were amazing. The whole museum's atmosphere was one of complete dedication and love for their history.

The outside boasts one of Korea's oldest and largest iron bells which rings every hour (I think). On the back of the museum grounds there are two pagodas in different styles and lots of stone artifacts.

The inside has the whole Silla history from the very beginning of the Paleolithic, and the eventual transition to Silla is fascinating.

Worth the visit.

They provide wheelchairs."
"I thought this was an excellent museum. It's of medium size and the collection of artifacts is impressive but most of all I appreciated that ALL the written text posted was available in korean and English which meant i learnt a lot during my visit. The exhibits are nicely presented, well kept -there are a couple of different buildings to explore. You should not miss this if you are visiting Gyeongju."
"This is a great museum which provides a fascinating look into Korean history and the history of the immediate area and would recommend it as a first stop if you are planning to spend a lot of time in the area. When we visited in April 2014 there was an amazing exhibition of artefacts from the Shilla tombs, but there was a wealth of other stuff to look at, covering centuries. It's HUGE, so you will get tired before you see it all. Two or three hours and you'll feel saturated with information.
It's incredibly popular with massive school groups (as are most sights in Gyeongju), so check the opening times and go later if you want to avoid the hordes. It's just a short walk to the Anapji pond if you are in the area, and from there you can easily walk back into town, but there are plenty of bus routes which serve the museum too.
Nice gift shop but there didn't appear to be a cafe, just vending machines."
"Great exhibits, even with the limited English translations one can get a quick overview into early Korean history of theSilla period, which enables a better understanding of the other historical sites to be viewed around the area."
"Free entry to the museum, which makes it a must go. You get to see all the jewelry and stuff recovered from the tomb and it gives a good guide on the history of the Shilla dynasty and historical background of Korea and brief corresponding historical timeline of China and Japan."
"While many of the important artifacts are only replicas (the real ones are in Seoul), the museum is still a nice place to start your visit to Gyeongju. There are exhibits showing and explaining many of the sites, for example, Anapji, Seokguram and the tombs. At certain times there are volunteers conducting tours in English for free. There is also a play area for younger children where they can make a rubbing of their Chinese zodiac or a clay face tile. Starting at the museum gives a great overview of the area and can help you plan your other destinations."
"The museum was free the day we went, but the audio tour was ₩2000 a piece. Sometimes they're bad, but especially with all of the somewhat confusing treasures in this museum, it was super helpful. It identifies objects by proximity and automatically turns on.

The best part of the collection, I thought, was the stuff from Anapji Pond's archeological sites, and some artifacts from the Silla kingdom period.

Overall, this fits in with the general, ""wow, Gyeongju is amazing"" theme of the whole trip there."
"We visited this museum as part of an organized tour. Unfortunately it rained very hard and the museum was full of very noisy school kids. It turned out that it was ""National Historical Appreciation Day"" in Korea, hence all of the school children.

That to one side it was a very interesting museum with some good displays and lots of information in English.

Well worth the visit."
"located at a walk distance from the center of gyeongju, this museum is free of charge, which happens very seldom and it gives you an idea of the past splendour of this amazing city.
it's very clean and well kept. i found it quite interesting"
"Gyeongju museum was excellent , learnt a lot on the Shilla Dynasty and the articles found in that area. Lotsa repetitive articles like pots places there."
"If you have been to some of the temples in Gyeongju it is a must to go to this museum. It not only contains the treasures found in most of the temples and burial mounds, but also has all the information to let all visitors understand about the ancient Shilla dynasty found inside Korea's Southeastern area. It has many everyday items as well as the king's crown of gold and many weaponry from that era."
"I find this museum a very good museum to introduce visitors to the history of the Silla kingdom period, which unified the Korean peninsula into one country after centuries of divisions into various states and kingdoms. The museum is within walking distance from Oreung(the Five Tombs complex), Daereungwon (the Great Tomb Park), and some other tourist attractions, and the entrance fee is basically FREE! The only catch is that you have to get a ticket for admission(free but necessary) at the front gate. Various parts of the outer compounds of this museum have items such as the great bell of Hwangnyongsa, the bodhisattvas or fragments of their buff relief in a row outdoors. I recommend visiting this museum during the warmer months of spring and summer, or even during early autumn during October, when the leaves start changing color.

There are various exhibition halls dedicated to various periods of Korean history, prior to the formation of the Silla kingdom, the formation of the Silla kingdom, and its rise and decline. They are not considered big nor small, and manageable within 2 hours or so, but the highlight of the exhibitions are by far the gold metallurgy that the Silla blacksmiths are best-known for. These include the crowns and head-dress and belts of Silla royalty and nobility."
Visited Gyeongju National Museum along with my business colleague. This place has lots of ancient items of historic importance and depicts nicely Korean history. A good half day is required to see full museum. Nice and memorable visit!!!
The museum does a good job at explaining the history of the sila kingdom that used Gyeongju as it's capital. The main hall is where the core of the collection sits. The explanations are in English and one can follow them easily. You can take bus 10 or 11 from town to get here or just walk through a large filed of flowers (August). Best of all it's free.
I toured with a handbell choir. We all enjoyed seeing the huge bell outside the museum. We also enjoyed seeing the original pieces from the nearby Gyeongsangbuk tomb.
"The cultural assets are vet well preserved and exhibited in several categories, such as arts, history and so on. It would be better if they expand exhibition rooms and add some more detailed explanation about the properties."
"One of the most informative museums I have ever been to. The displays and their explanation were clear, concise, and informative. The curators should be congratulated. As some of the guidebooks recommend, you may want to start your visit to gyeingju here, since it puts the rest of the sites in perspective. As a bonus,the admission is free! Allow about an hour and a half."
"Gyeongju is kind of rainy, and the tourist kiosk told us that the museum is pretty much the only thing to do when it rains.

It's a modest-sized museum with a few different buildings. Signs in English are well-translated. Near Anapji Pond and other attractions. There are beverage vending machines and bathrooms, but no food court."
"This museum is a fascinating look at the rise of civilization in southeastern Korea. It is largely frequented by Koreans. On our visit, we were the only Westerners in sight. Signs in English were well written and frequent enough to give an excellent view into Korea's past history. I loved looking through the artifacts which included dynastic crowns. The grounds were also lovely and well manicured. Keeping with the Korean tradition, many artifacts are displayed outside, including the largest extant bell in Korea. Overall a lovely respite from the heat."
"This a museum effectively dedicated to the Silla era, housing the many thousands of artefacts that have been found in the area. These are well displayed although more English explanations would have made it better. It is amazing to see such advanced works from such an old civilisation. Look out for the crowns which are amazing .... wouldn't mind owning some of that other jewelry too! Free entrance to the permanent exhibition"
"Was there this morning and unfortunately did not get to visit this most talked about museum as it was closed.

Dont make the same mistake as me. The Gyeongju Museum is closed on Mondays.

Cheers!"
"So much of this town is outside so when it rains it can be difficult to be entertained as a tourist. We decided to go to this museum to stay out of the rain and did not regret it, the complex is modern and spacious and able to accomadate many people, just as well as it seemed everybody else had the same idea. The artifacts are interesting and varied, and it would have been nice to have a little more in English, but hey we are in Korea. It is a great places to go, and from what I saw of the grounds it would be god to go on a sunny day. Recommended"
"It is near to the anapji pond, I would suggest to come visit museum then go to anapji. I was here 1 hour before the museum close and the exhibition is well organized. I enjoy reading those history of Shilla emperor here."
"This museum accurately captures Korean history dating back to prehistoric times, and focuses on the Silla Dynasty Period. Located on the former site of a Silla Palace, as Gyeongju was the captial city of Chosun during this time, the museum invokes the entire region in both permanent indoor and outdoor exhibition.

I feel my tour group did not spend enough time here, as there is much to see and process, but I definitely left with a greater understanding and appreciation for Korean history and culture."
"The artefacts on display are amazing but there isn't really any storyline to follow which makes it really difficult to understand what the Silla kingdom was, developed and fell.

Many signs are not translated and some contains only shortened English translations.

We got an audio guide which only read what was written anyway on the signs which made the 2000 won per person spent badly. It was read with a robotic voice and at about half the speed you'd read it yourself.

But make an effort to piece together the storyline and the collection is really incredible."
"I would say unless you are a keen Korean history student this museum can be slightly disappointing. It is split into several separate buildings, which does not help, specially in wet weather. The ruins of statuary in the garden can be considerably more attractive than the indoor collect. To be fair, Korea has had a very agitated history, so that probably explains why much of her heritage is in a poor state of preservation, specially considering how much of it there is/was. Also, I suspect the main findings have been taken to Seoul, so whatever has been left behind in Gyeongju is probably sub-prime. At least the entrance is free."
"This is a great museum. It's small enough to get around in a couple of hours, but it contains some fascinating exhibits about the Silla Kingdom.
The Sillas didn't make it to the Australian school curricula,despite lasting for almost 1,000 years. In a way, they are the missing piece linking the Chinese and Japanese empires, and it could be argued that they had as big a role to play in the culture of North East Asia as did the Chinese dynasties.
Go just to see the golden crowns."
"When travelling around South Korea there are many signs referring to 'Shilla' eg Shilla Hotel and restaurants named after it.

Gyeongju was the ancient capital of the Shilla Dynasty and the explanations in this museum helps you see a little of what life was like then.

The buildings, gardens and compounds are beautiful and well laid out. The displays are clearly explained and logically set out. Our whole family learned a lot about the Shilla Kingdom and what it meant for Korea to have this kind of history.

Practicalities: entry is free. There is a free car park, a small tea shop and a gift shop. This is an extremely popular trip for visiting school children but they are well behaved and the teachers and museum caretakers are careful to move the children along at a good pace. You will be able to see all the exhibitions with no problems."
"I had a beautiful afternoon in Gyeongju getting to know Korea's historic heart, and this excellent museum was a highlight of my visit.The museum really helped me to feel that I had experienced a little bit of ancient Silla. Great exhibits, easily absorbed in a short visit, and I learned a lot too! Groovy cafe, great coffee and lovely grounds.

The 20 minute walk from the station to the museum takes in quite a bit of the historic area, the burial mounds and a couple of temples. I even got to have a quick shop along the main street before taking the train on to my next stop.

Short and sweet. Like so many places in Korea, I feel that I could happily go back and spend a week there, but also feel satisfied to have had just a small taste."
Excellent museum with lots of fascinating exhibits and information to help you understand the surrounding sites in particular and Korean culture in general. Lots of the descriptions are in English and there are English speaking guides who are very help to help. You'll need at least 2 hours to do it justice.
Gyeongju has an incredible past. This museum captures the stories behind the artifacts and takes you back to the origins of the kingdom. Love the tomb excavation exhibits. We rented the English audio guide and loved that it was so high-tech that it knew what exhibit we were standing in front of and moved the tape to that selection. Amazing how many exhibits the museum had and that it was free. Would have cost a fortune to see an exhibit like this in most other countries. We understood much more about ancient Korea's relationships with Mongolia and Japan after this museum experience. Fascinating culture!
